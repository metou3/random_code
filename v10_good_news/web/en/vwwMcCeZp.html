                      <p>Visitors enjoying body boarding in the ocean off Assateague Island, Maryland, were joined by some unusual bathers this summer — a herd of wild horses.  The herd can be seen on the beach with the surf lapping at their legs in this video uploaded to Facebook on July 20 by Karen DePace.  “This is the first time in 10 years that I personally have seen them [the horses] playing in the ocean,” Maryland resident DePace told Storyful.  DePace said that three park rangers were with the horses “to ensure their safety” as they cooled off in the water.  She said it was a “very hot day. ” The horses are descendants of domestic animals that reverted to a wild state, according to the National Park Service , who encourage visitors to the island to “enjoy their beauty from a distance. ” Credit: Karen DePace via Storyful</p>
