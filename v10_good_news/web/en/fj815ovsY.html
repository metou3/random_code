Living with a parrot is a big commitment.  Parrots live a very long time.   A parrot such as Einstein can live to be 50 or 60 years old.  Many larger parrots like Macaws can live to be 100 years old.  They all require a lot of care, proper nutrition, training, time, and patience.  Parrots need a lot of attention and lots of toys and activities to keep from being bored.  Parrots are also expensive, a large cage is an investment, and plenty of play perches to spend out of cage time.  Specialized veterinarian care is also required.  Most of all they require your companionship and a forever home.  Many people decide after the first few years of parrot ownership that the responsibility is too great and the parrots become neglected and sometimes abandoned.  When that happens they are sent to parrot rescue facilities to be adopted by a new family or some spend their lives in sanctuaries.  It is often said, “Having a parrot is much like raising a raising a 2 to 3-year-old child for the rest of your life!”</p>
