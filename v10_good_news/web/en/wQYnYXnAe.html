                      <p>This is the adorable moment a 'real life Bambi and Thumper' were spotted hiking through the forest side by side.  Footage shows the wild deer and bunny walking along a forest trail during a summer's evening last month.  As the fawn steers off track to sniff the bushes, the black rabbit waits until he can resume walking alongside his friend.  The baby deer continues to follow the path at Cowichan Valley, British Columbia, Canada, with his furry friend hopping along side him -- reminiscent of Disney characters Bambi and Thumper who strike up a friendship during a walk in the woods. Filmed on 17th June 2020</p>
