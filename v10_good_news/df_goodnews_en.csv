In this video uploaded to Twitter on July 3, the young animal is seen eating from one of Helen Yanulus’s bird feeders before moving onto the next.  Seeing some movement indoors, the bear is seen making a run for it, and climbing down the deck.  With a largely undeveloped area near her property, Yanulus is accustomed to seeing a variety of wildlife, but she told Storyful that seeing a young bear climbing “up about a story to the top of the deck to investigate our seeds” is a first.

""We came to accompany the task of the inspectors and the Environmental Control brigade of the Ministry, who carry out an exemplary task taking care of the environment, protecting the fauna and controlling contaminating activities throughout the country,"" stressed the Minister of Environment. The first of the sea lions to appear was spotted by local residents on a road by the Gualeguaychú river, in the town of the same name in the province of Entre Ríos.  Days later, Ambiente participated in a new rescue operation for another specimen that was circulating in a private neighborhood located on the banks of the Luján River in the Buenos Aires municipality of Escobar.  The other two sea lions and the elephant seal were found in the following days in the Paraná delta area of ​​the Tigre district, province of Buenos Aires. The Civil Defense of Escobar and Tigre, the Tigre Operations Center (COT) and the Félix de Azara and Temaikèn foundations participated in the relief and assistance of the different animals, in the rescue center the first veterinary controls were carried out.  Once stabilized, a specialized team of inspectors from the national Ministry of Environment transferred the specimens to the Mundo Marino Foundation, where they remained until the present reintegration into the sea. The five animals had entered the delta of the Paraná River.  It is estimated that the reasons that led marine mammals to lose their habitat could be related to climatic events such as storms or floods or extraordinary downspouts, or due to the low supply of food in salty waters that ended up moving them away from their reference routes.

Einstein parrot is also famous for some of his silly quotes and sayings.  Online, Einstein, the talking parrot is popular across many social media platforms.  Einstein’s favorite places to talk at home is perched on the shower wall, in the kitchen on his drawer, and on his screened-in back porch.  As stated on his website, Einstein’s mission statement: “To entertain and bring joy, to foster the human-parrot bond, and to convey that parrots are deserving of immeasurable amounts of patience, nurturing, and companionship. ” Einstein’s website, einsteinparrot. com is designed to inform you about the care of parrots and also entertain you.  As previously mentioned, Einstein is popular on many social media sites such as YouTube @einsteinparrot, Instagram @einsteinparrot, Twitter @einsteinparrot, and Facebook @einsteintexanparrot.  Living with a parrot is a big commitment.  Parrots live a very long time.   A parrot such as Einstein can live to be 50 or 60 years old.  Many larger parrots like Macaws can live to be 100 years old.  They all require a lot of care, proper nutrition, training, time, and patience.  Parrots need a lot of attention and lots of toys and activities to keep from being bored.  Parrots are also expensive, a large cage is an investment, and plenty of play perches to spend out of cage time.  Specialized veterinarian care is also required.  Most of all they require your companionship and a forever home.  Many people decide after the first few years of parrot ownership that the responsibility is too great and the parrots become neglected and sometimes abandoned.  When that happens they are sent to parrot rescue facilities to be adopted by a new family or some spend their lives in sanctuaries.  It is often said, “Having a parrot is much like raising a raising a 2 to 3-year-old child for the rest of your life!”"#http://192.168.0.26:5006/web/en/fj815ovsY#fj815ovsY#238#20#4491#0#0
