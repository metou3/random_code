Ringneck parrots are known for their talking abilities, but that doesn’t always guarantee that they will.  Ringneck parrots need to be interacted with daily and need a lot of mental stimulation so they don’t get bored.  They can get loud and do go through what’s called a bluffing stage.  If you’ve never owned a bird, I would not recommend this type of parrot as your first.  Always do your research before bringing home a parrot.  Ringneck parrots can live anywhere between 25 years of age and above. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/talking-parrot-says-choo-choo-220520251.html#p1qMKhoy8

Yet few could deny that the couple have had quite a year, snapping up a sprawling Californian mansion and signing a string of lucrative business deals.  Perhaps mindful of their triumph in the face of perceived adversity, the couple used their first Spotify podcast on Tuesday to send a poignant message to their supporters, telling them: ""Trust us when we say love always wins. "" They reinforced the message with a personal song choice, ""Amen, This Little Light of Mine"", by Karen Gibson and the Kingdom Choir, which was played at their wedding, as they wished listeners a Happy New Year.  ""Not a toast per se, but a song, which is about shining a light,"" the Duke said.  ""The message of this song is one we hold so dearly.  It's about using the power we each have within us to make this world a better place. "" The Duchess quoted Martin Luther King as she said: ""It was the music that we wanted playing when we started our lives together.  Because as we all know, 'darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that'. """#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/love-always-wins-duke-duchess-162346766.html#4A2VEmBZy

These islands are very new in geological terms, having emerged from the ocean due to volcanic eruptions 400 million years ago.  Barren and lifeless, they were simply chunks of cooled lava until the surface changed over many years to support the first plants.  They were followed long after by sea birds and then animals that found their way there on rafts of floating vegetation.  Very slowly, the islands became home to many species of plants and animals, cut off from the rest of the world by the great distance from other land masses.  Life here on the islands has evolved on its own line, with animals adapting to long periods of drought and hardship.  They have developed unique traits and physical characteristics that were important for the survival of the species.  The people of the Galapagos understand and respect the delicate balance of nature in this world.  They exist in harmony with the animals and interfere as little as possible.  They encourage others to respect this as well, and tourists are gently reminded to let nature take care of its own.  But the pelicans are one of the exceptions.  Large, strong birds with few predators, they have little fear of the humans who bring in their morning catch of fish and lobster.  They pelicans have learned that there might be scraps and entrails to be had when the boats come in to the harbour.  This fish market on Santa Cruz is a popular destination for tourists and also for the locals.  The pelicans are not the only creatures looking for a free meal.  Marine iguanas, giant frigates, herons, and also sea lions patrol the sidewalk and areas around the counter as the fishermen cut the fish and get it ready for sale.  Locals come for the opportunity of a fresh purchase, and also for the entertainment as the animals gather in great numbers.  Throwing the entrails in the garbage and taking them to the landfill will result in scavengers getting their meals there.  It makes just as much sense to toss the waste in the direction of the eager and hungry mob of animals at the counter.  The pelicans scramble to move out of the way as people walk through, but they quickly line up again, salivating and keeping a sharp eye on the fish.  As the pelicans are tossed a large chunk by the generous fisherman, they squawk in what sounds much like comical human laughter.  While in the Galapagos Islands, a trip to the fish market is an absolute must, especially with a camera. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hungry-pelicans-galapagos-fish-market-150006242.html#giAZDgOb8

The recipes in his tasty collection are endlessly creative and fresh — ranging from BBQ portobello patties with roasted peppers to marinated bean and avocado burgers with smoked tomatoes. Martin Nordin Green Burgers, $, available at AmazonPhoto: Courtesy of Green Burgers. BBQ Portobello Burger With Grilled Peppers & Mayonnaise Makes 6 burgersIngredients4 grilled and steamed spring onions (see below) 1 lb.  5 oz.  portobello mushrooms Rapeseed or peanut oil for frying 2 finely chopped garlic cloves 1 tbsp butter 3 1/2 oz.  finely chopped day-old sourdough bread 10 fl.  oz.  BBQ sauce 2 eggs Pinch of sea saltTo Serve2–3 red (bell) peppers 6 burger buns Butter for the buns Lettuce leaves 2 1/2 cups of mayonnaise Fresh herbs, e. g.  marjoram, oregano and thymeInstructions1.  Grill and steam the spring onions as described below. 2.  Cut the mushrooms into 1/4 in.  cubes.  Heat the oil in a frying pan (skillet) over a high heat until it starts to smoke.  Add the mushrooms and fry them for 10–15 minutes so they develop some color. 3.  Chop the steamed spring onions, and, together with the garlic, add them to the mushrooms in the pan.  Add the butter and reduce the heat to medium.  Fry for a few minutes while stirring. 4.  Remove the frying pan from the heat and transfer the mushroom mixture to a bowl.  Allow it to cool. 5.  Add the finely chopped bread, BBQ sauce and eggs to the mushrooms in the bowl.  Stir so that all the ingredients are well combined, and add a little salt to taste. 6.  Take a handful of mixture at a time and shape into 6 round patties, either by hand or using a food ring.  Put the burgers in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably longer, then they will hold together better when you fry them. 7.  Preheat the oven to 350ºF. 8.  Light the barbecue and grill the peppers well all over so they go black on the outside.  I usually add the peppers while the fuel is still actively flaming – ideally over a wood fire.  (You can also grill (broil) the peppers in the oven on maximum heat until they are almost completely black. ) Transfer the peppers into a plastic bag and let them cool for about 10 minutes.  Then rub off the skin by massaging them while they are still in the bag.  Cut the peppers into equal-sized pieces. 9.  Take the portobello patties from the fridge and brush them with oil.  Fry them in a frying pan for a few minutes on both sides so they develop a nice colour and a crispy surface.  Transfer to an ovenproof dish and bake them in the oven for 10 minutes. 10.  Butter the buns on the cut surface and fry them quickly in a frying pan or grill them in the oven. 11.  Place a patty on the bottom of each bun.  Put a lettuce leaf, some pieces of grilled pepper and a generous splash of mayonnaise on top.  Finish off with fresh herbs. Grilled & Steamed Spring OnionsMakes enough for 6 burgersIngredients1/2 cup olive oil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 spring onions (scallions)Instructions1.  Pour the oil into a ziplock bag big enough to accommodate the spring onions.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Put the bag next to the barbecue so it is close at hand. 2.  Light the barbecue.  Lay the spring onions on the grid while the charcoal is still actively flaming.  Cook the onions all over so the surface gets a little burnt. 3.  Using tongs, transfer the spring onions to the ziplock bag.  Seal the bag and shake it so the oil covers all the onions.  Leave them in the bag for about 20 minutes so they steam in their own heat.

Tackling TLC-style dishes can be fast, fresh, and easy with a little help from our favorite seasonal kitchen gadget and this delicious guidebook. Melissa Clark Dinner in an Instant Cookbook, $, available at AmazonLeek & Artichoke FrittataServes 4Ingredients1 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more for the soufflé dish 5 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 small leeks (white and light green parts only), halved and thinly sliced 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more as needed ½ cup milk 2 tbsp all-purpose flour 9 large eggs 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil or parsley ½ tsp finely chopped fresh thyme ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper ¾ cup (about 2 ounces) Gruyère cheese, shredded ⅓ cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely choppedInstructions1.  Butter a 1½-qt.  soufflé dish and dust the sides with 2 tbsp of the Parmesan.  Set it aside. 2.  Using the sauté function, heat the 1 tbsp butter and the oil in the pressure cooker.  Stir in the leeks and ¼ tsp of the salt, and cook, stirring often and lowering the heat if necessary (and possible) to prevent burning, until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. 3.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the milk and flour.  Then whisk in the eggs, basil, thyme, remaining ¾ tsp salt, pepper, and Gruyère. 4.  Turn off the heat and stir the artichokes into the leeks.  Then mix the leek mixture into the egg mixture.  Scrape that mixture into the prepared soufflé dish.  Cover it with aluminum foil. 5.  Pour 1½ cups water into the pressure cooker.  You can either place a steamer rack in the bottom of the pot and then lower the soufflé dish onto the rack using a homemade sling, or, if you have a rack with an attached handle, lower the rack and dish all at once.  Cover and cook on high pressure for 16 minutes. 6.  Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, and then release the remaining pressure manually.  Using oven mitts, remove the soufflé dish from the pressure cooker.  Remove the foil. 7.  Heat the broiler.  Sprinkle the remaining 3 tbsp Parmesan over the frittata, and broil until it is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. Reprinted from Dinner in an Instant.

Simply VibrantBest For: ""I Can't Believe It's Plant-Based"" DishesBringing the heat to your vegetarian dining game for the iced-over months ahead is as easy as picking up a copy of Anya Kassoff's Simply Vibrant — the bright, plant-based cookbook is overflowing with healthy and imaginative seasonal recipe magic.  There's everything from savory sweet potato dumplings to hearty black-bean hummus burritos that will warm up this week's lunch to dinner plans. Anya Kassoff Simply Vibrant, $, available at AmazonSmoky Cauliflower & Black Bean Hummus Burritos Makes 6 to 8 burritos Black Bean Hummus Ingredients1 cup dried black beans, soaked in purified water overnight 2 bay leaves and/or 2-inch piece kombu (optional) 1 cup torn fresh cilantro leaves and stems 1/2 ripe but not mushy avocado, peeled and pitted 1/2 jalapeño, seeded and roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and freshly ground Sea salt and freshly ground black pepperSmoky Cauliflower Ingredients4 tbsp neutral coconut oil, divided 1 large yellow onion, chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets 1/2 jalapeño or other chili, finely chopped 1 tsp smoked Spanish paprika 1 tsp pure maple syrup 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime or lemon juiceBurrito Ingredients6 to 8 homemade tortillas (recipe below) or large store-bought whole-grain tortillas or wraps2 cups baby spinach, microgreens, or chopped lettuce Fresh cilantro leaves 1/2 ripe avocado, cubed (optional) Juice of 1 lime (optional)Black Bean Hummus Instructions1.  Drain and rinse the beans and cover them with water in a medium pot.  Add the bay leaves and/or kombu, if using, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.  Lower the heat to a simmer, partially cover the pot, and cook the beans for about 30 minutes, until they are soft and buttery but not mushy inside.  Drain the beans, reserving 2 tbsp of the cooking liquid for this recipe and storing the rest for future use in a soup or stew, if desired.  Let the beans cool and discard the bay leaves or kombu. 2.  In a food processor, combine the beans, cilantro, avocado, jalapeño, garlic, lemon juice, ground cumin seeds, and salt and pepper to taste.  Process until smooth, adding some of the reserved bean cooking liquid as you go to achieve a smooth consistency.  You’ll have more hummus than you need for this recipe.  Leftover hummus is great as a dip and on tartines or sandwiches; store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Smoky Cauliflower Instructions1.  Warm 1 tbsp of the coconut oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the onion, salt, and pepper, and sauté for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden and caramelized.  Remove the onion from the pan and set it aside. 2.  Return the pan to medium heat and warm the remaining 3 tbsp of coconut oil.  Add the cauliflower to the pan in a single layer, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly browned.  Flip the florets and cook on the other side for another 3 to 5 minutes.  Continue to cook for a couple more minutes to achieve even caramelization. 3.  Add the jalapeño and paprika to the pan with the cauliflower and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until the cauliflower is golden brown.  Drizzle with the maple syrup and lime or lemon juice.  Sauté for a minute or two until the liquid reduces into a glaze.  Stir in the caramelized onion and remove the pan from the heat. Burrito Instructions1.  Place one tortilla on a serving plate and spread 2 tbsp of black bean hummus on top.  Add about 2 spoonfuls of smoky cauliflower, followed by a small handful of spinach or other greens.  Top with some cilantro, avocado, and lime juice. 2.  Fold the lower end of the tortilla over the filling, followed by the sides, and then roll it tightly into a burrito.  Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings.  I prefer to make fresh burritos right before eating, but you can also make these in advance to take with you and enjoy for lunch or at an outing. Sprouted/Whole Spelt Tortillas Makes 16 tortillas Ingredients3 cups sprouted or whole spelt flour 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp baking powder ⅓ cup soft neutral coconut oil or other neutral vegetable oil 1 ¼ cup purified warm waterInstructions1.  Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center, add oil and water, and mix to combine, gradually incorporating flour into oil and water well.  Knead into a soft dough.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. 2.  Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a thick rope.  Cut each rope in half, continuing to cut in this manner, until you have 16 equally sized pieces.  Make a ball out of each piece, flatten each with the palm of your hand and keep covered. 3.  Thoroughly warm a medium pan over medium high heat. 4.  Roll each piece at a time into a 6 to 7-in.  circle on a well-floured working surface.  Transfer one piece at a time into the hot pan and cook for about 1 minute on one side, until bubbles appear, and a few pale spots are visible on the underside.  Flip and cook for another 30 seconds.  Remove from the pan and keep wrapped in a clean kitchen towel. 5.  Continue with the rest of the tortillas, stacking them on top of each other and keeping them covered.  They are at best when used right away. Excerpted from Simply Vibrant by Anya Kassoff © 2018 by Anya Kassoff.  Photographs © 2018 by Masha Davydova.

Whisk together the brown sugar, peanut butter, sesame oil, soy sauce, Sriracha, vinegar, water, and lime juice in a medium-size bowl until smooth.  Set aside 1/4 cup of the peanut sauce for serving. 3.  Rub the broccolini and chicken with the remaining peanut sauce to thickly coat, and arrange them in a tight single layer on the prepared pan.  Broil, keeping a close eye on the pan to prevent burning, and flipping the chicken halfway through, until the chicken is just cooked through, the broccolini is well charred, and the sauce is bubbly and deeply browned, 10 to 12 minutes. 4.  Serve the chicken and broccolini hot from the oven with the reserved dipping sauce alongside.

They are large and powerful animals with the males reaching a weight of up to 46kg (102lbs).  Most Arctic wolves are found in northern Canada.  Artic wolves have relatively little fear of people, thought to be due to their infrequent exposure to humans.  Although attacks on humans are rare, a few documented cases exist.  The Arctic wolf's primary food source is the muskoxen and Arctic hares, although they also feed on caribou and lemmings.  Capable hunters, the Arctic wolf has been found on two occasions to have preyed upon polar bear cubs.  Beautiful animals, the wolf symbolizes bravery, as in the association with the hunter or the warrior in folklore.  They are a vital part of any ecosystem they are part of, maintaining a delicate balance of other animals such as hares, beaver, and caribou.  Without them, populations of other creatures would go unchecked and the result to the ecosystem would be disastrous.  Studies have shown that without wolves, some areas experience an overpopulation of beavers, and ultimately, rivers and watersheds are permanently changed. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pack-arctic-wolves-settle-nap-155008859.html#Wg3LSz2lo

Brandy Rohlf, Jace’s mother, shared footage of the heartwarming encounter to Facebook. “[Jace] waits every day for the UPS guys to drive by,” she wrote in her post.  “If he is not outside waiting for them he sits at the window and watches for them.  They ALWAYS honk and wave and look for him in the window.  Today they stopped by and gave Jace a gift because they noticed his excitement when they drive by. ”Rohlf told Storyful that Angelman Syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder, causes developmental disabilities, difficulty with motor function and speech, and “a very happy and excitable demeanor. ”“The driver’s wife sent me a message and told me they can’t wait to go by our house,” Rohlf told Storyful. “It’s the highlight of their day too.  They look forward to it just as much as Jace does. ”The drivers gave Jace a UPS-branded hat, a toy truck, and some candy, Rohlf said.

Ask a well-traveled friend where you should vacation in Spain post pandemic, and you’ll likely get an earful on Barcelona’s dreamy architecture, San Sebastián’s epic pintxo crawls, and Sevilla’s foot-stomping flamenco tablaos.  But here’s my hot tip as a six-year Spain transplant who travels to pay the bills: Some of the most exciting news in Spanish travel for 2021 is out of Cáceres, a sleepy medieval city located 180 miles west of Madrid. I first visited Cáceres in 2017, lured by the promise of porcine delights (acorn-fed ham! spicy patatera sausage!), orange tree-shaded plazas, and one of the best-preserved medieval enclaves in Europe.  Approaching the city, I remember gasping at the skyline, all right angles with its low whitewashed houses and 30-some towers, some nearly 1,000 years old.  Brick steeples and cupolas shot up between them, lending an aristocratic grandeur to the place.  Storks soared overhead. My first walk through the Ciudad Monumental, or Old Town, revealed sinuous streets lined with mansions, churches, and monasteries built from stone, a foreboding sepia-tinged maze built to last.  Perusing the placards on each historical facade as if I were touring a museum, I struggled to find a single building newer than the 16th century.  Ornate coats of arms hovering above doorways bore the seals of fairytale surnames that were fun to say aloud: Godoy, Saavedra, Golfín, and Ovando-Mogollón.  Everything was preserved as if in amber.  The only glaring signs of modernity came in the form of film crew vans and extension cords: The Old Town was being used as a Game of Thrones filming location. Cáceres peaked early and then sort of calcified.  Though the Romans, Jews, and Moors laid the city’s groundwork, erecting towers and installing cisterns (the one beneath the Museum of Cáceres is worth a visit), the city’s heyday was between the late 15th and mid-17th centuries.  It was during that period that explorers from the surrounding region—such as Hernán Cortés, Francisco de Orellana, and Francisco Pizarro—brought back shiploads of plundered riches from the so-called New World to fund the city’s opulent constructions. But then, due the royals’ financial mismanagement, the money dried up.  Simultaneously, Cáceres was caught in the crossfire of a protracted war over Portugal, forcing many residents to flee.  By the turn of the 20th century, the city was an impoverished, sparsely populated backwater ravaged by centuries of latifundism and neglect.  People only began giving Cáceres a second look in 1967, when the Council of Europe declared it the third most significant monumental ensemble on the continent, bested only by Tallinn and Prague.  UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site in 1986. The irony of Cáceres’s dark chapter is that it may have saved the Ciudad Monumental from ruin.  Had the city remained prosperous through the centuries, its Old Town would’ve been wrecked to make way for newer buildings. As the weekend unfolded, I was struck by how well suited Cáceres was to excursions from Madrid.  It had it all: stunning churches (I’ll never forget the view from the bell tower of Iglesia de San Francisco Javier), tasty tapas served with gusto, and hotels for every budget.  Toledo and Segovia are the most popular field trips from the Spanish capital, but while fascinating in their own right, they’re in-your-face touristy (think magnets and postcards in every corner shop).  Cáceres, by comparison, felt like a real vacation—it oozed Spanish history and culture without a tourbus in sight. After that trip, I talked up Cáceres to anyone who’d listen, but I didn’t have a pressing reason to return until earlier this month, when I got wind of a flurry of news developments: a hotel opening, a museum expansion, revamped official tours, and a new restaurant run by one of Spain’s top chefs.  Finally, I thought, Cáceres would get the international buzz it deserves.  But then it dawned on me: With leisure travel at a standstill and foreigners largely banned from visiting Spain, Cáceres’s biggest year in over a decade could potentially go unnoticed abroad, another blow to the already-hamstrung tourism industry.  Determined to spread the gospel, I bought a train ticket, packed a bunch of masks, and set out to see what there was to look forward to in Cáceres in the After Times. After ditching my suitcase at the NH Collection Cáceres Palacio de Oquendo, a reliable mid-range hotel housed in a 16th-century stone palace, I zigzagged up into the Old Town.  It was pin-drop quiet—no cars, no people, just the squeak of my shoes on the wet cobblestones.  My first stop was the Helga Alvear Contemporary Art Museum.  When I came here in 2017, I left scratching my head: The low-ceilinged medieval building housed confusingly conceptual art (a pyramid of multicolored balls, garments pinned to a folded rug), and the collection felt clunky and out of place.  The German art collector has since thrown money at the problem to the tune of €10 million.  Tuñón Architects (of MUSAC fame) are behind the renovation, which added 54,000 square feet to the existing 32,000.  From outside the building, I could make out Tuñón’s signature wooden slats peeking above the scaffolding.  “It’s going to feel like a completely new museum,” a representative told me over the phone, adding that it would open “sometime” in 2021.  “The new space will allow us to finally showcase large-format pieces from the collection that we weren’t previously able to display. ”The Helga Alvear is a five-minute walk from the heart of the old Judería, or Jewish Quarter, a tangle of narrow streets and white single-story houses huddled around the Ermita de San Antonio, originally the main synagogue.  “Jewish Cáceres” is one of several new niche-interest tours that the local tourist office will launch in 2021, alongside other itineraries like “Muslim Cáceres,” “Roman Cáceres,” and a route hitting the city’s most scenic viewpoints.  (Stop by the tourist office on the Plaza Mayor to inquire about tour schedules. )But perhaps the most thrilling developments of all are in Cáceres’s hospitality sector.  To be fair, there was already plenty to rave about: The city is home to one of Spain’s most exclusive design hotels, Atrio, presided over by Cáceres-born partners (in both business and love) Toño Pérez and José Polo.  Atrio’s rooms are dramatically lit and bear original works by Warhol, Tapiès, Ruff, and Saura.  Downstairs, Pérez runs a two-Michelin-star kitchen where Extremaduran delicacies like lomo doblao (Ibérico pork loin confited lard) and torta del Casar (a creamy, grassy ewe’s-milk cheese) are woven into tasting menus that will have you crunching on a tapioca “butterfly” filled with salmon mousse one minute and braised partridge draped with black truffles the next. The duo’s latest passion project, slated to open in the second half of 2021, is an 11-suite hotel catty-corner from Atrio called Casa Palacio Paredes Saavedra.  “It’s shaping up phenomenally,” Polo told me over coffee and meringues.  “The accommodations are going to be enormous.  One of the suites has a 215-square-foot bathroom—that, to me, is true luxury. ” Evidently Tuñón Arquitectos has had a busy year.  In addition to the Helga Alvear, they’re undertaking the gut renovation and redesign of this 16th-century mansion.  When it’s finished, guests paying upwards of €800 a night will be able to enjoy amenities like his-and-hers showers, heated floors, butler service, and deep-sink tubs cut from single slabs of Italian marble.  There are plans to turn the original subterranean cistern into a candlelit sauna and hammam. Pérez’s food is peerless in Cáceres, but cheap it ain’t.  So when the couple announced that they were taking over Torre de Sande, the middling casual restaurant next door, and opening an informal Extremaduran asador (grill restaurant) in its place, locals jumped for joy.  The space, which opened this month, is absolutely stunning.  Torre de Sande is named for the 14th-century tower it occupies, so you can imagine the bones: stone pillars, vaulted ceilings, rough-hewn stone walls.  In fact, Pérez and Polo rent the place from a viscount (!), who gave his blessing for them to queer-eye the place—hola, deliciously dim track lighting and black marble tabletops.  Covid willing, you’ll be able to enjoy Pérez’s smoky roast meats and locavore tapas outside on the ivy-fringed patio come summer.  But whether a trip to Spain is in the cards next year or in 10, Cáceres will doubtlessly still be there, standing proud. Where to StayAtrio is one of the most exalted hotels in Spain—with rates to match.  More affordable launching pads include the NH Collection Cáceres Palacio de Oquendo, situated 100 yards from the bustling Plaza Mayor, and Gran Hotel Don Manuel, a few blocks north of the Old Town.  Both hotels stand out for their genial service and hearty breakfasts yet are equally a bit frayed at the edges (chipped paint and flimsy towels—that sort of thing). Where to EatBeyond Atrio and Torre de Sande, there are few truly great restaurants inside the Old Town.  Take a six-minute taxi ride to Javier Martín in the Nuevo Cáceres neighborhood, and you’ll be rewarded with shockingly well-priced tasting menus and ample à la carte options ranging from Ibérico pork carpaccio to creamy lobster rice to Almadraba tuna tataki.  Far more casual, in the best way possible, is La Marina, a third-generation bar that churns out unapologetically old-school raciones like white gazpacho, eggs scrambled with lamb brains, and zarangollo, a zippy Extremaduran salad of smoky roasted peppers and good Spanish tuna finished with a garlicky vinaigrette and a few flicks of parsley.

Bexleyheath, London, resident Gemma McPherson was expecting a pair of shoes to be delivered when she got a notification on her phone that her front doorbell camera had been activated. “I knew someone was coming down the pathway.  I headed to the front door and I could hear what sounded like drums and singing,” McPherson told Storyful. Her son answered the door and collected the package from the deliveryman, said thank you, and sent him on his way. “Because I could hear something I decided to check on my Ring doorbell camera.  And to my surprise it was him, the delivery driver, he was so lovely, happy, festive, and cheery,” McPherson said. This video shows the delivery driver, Arnaud Helderal, walking up the driveway, singing a Christmas tune to himself as he taps on the package like a drum and dances a bit. McPherson posted the video to a local Facebook page and several people commented sharing similar experiences, and it became clear that Helderal had unknowingly been spreading holiday cheer to residences all around Bexleyheath. McPherson called DPD to let them know how pleased she was with her driver, and that she wanted to nominate him for an award to thank him for his incredible service. “The very next day after receiving the award of recognition, he turned up at my doorstep and gave my son who answered the door that day the mug he received from work,” she told Storyful. “We have seen him since and he has said how overwhelmed he is and how thankful he is,” she says, and that he has even stopped by since just to say hello.

They are a strikingly beautiful turtle with a shell that resembles a fallen leaf, and large owl-like eyes.  Capable of watching two things at once, their large eyes provide this turtle with very keen vision.  They inhabit the forest floor of heavily canopied areas in Vietnam and South East Asia, eating worms, insects, and fallen fruit.  Visual perception seems to be important to these small turtles as they readily feed on fruits and vegetables that are red, or brightly coloured.  They also seem to prefer overly ripe fruit, possibly also due to colour.  Although this turtle prefers to live near fresh water such as streams, it is a terrestrial turtle and does not live in the water.  These turtles reside at the Toronto Zoo in an elaborate and sizable enclosure that has fresh water, leaf substrate and a healthy population of these turtles for socialization.  Highly praised for both the living conditions for zoo families and their efforts to promote and fund conservation efforts world wide, the Toronto Zoo is an excellent organization.  The turtle in this video has just been fed.  Although his friends have also had their share, the lingering piece of his lunch on his beak has attracted the attention of one of his buddies.  He makes a beeline for the one with the food and helps him out by grabbing the morsel of food for himself.  The adorable little faces and expressive eyes make these turtles a joy to watch. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/worlds-smallest-turtle-gets-help-160003202.html#n2G2fxlxv

These tourists were aboard the FV FeBrina, a scuba diving liveaboard that took them around the remote waters in Papua New Guinea.  Exploring Kimbe Bay, they were treated to some to the most spectacular scuba diving in the world.  The coral reefs and ocean life are unrivaled in their beauty and diversity and the colours and sights beneath the waves are breathtaking.  But when they came up from an hour of exploration beneath the waves, they were surprised to be met by a few families from one of the remote islands.  They live off the land in a very traditional way with very little influence from the outside world and with very little exposure to technology.  Paddling out from their village in dugout canoes, the women brought fresh produce and coconuts.  In a form of commerce that is centuries old, the boat crew also provided the villagers with some essentials such as rice and cooking supplies.  They regularly donate books and school supplies to these island people as well, helping them with their own system of education.  The ocean provides the people of the islands with a lot of food also.  They spear fish and harvest sea cucumbers, crabs, and other edible creatures.  Life in this world has not changed much for the people in the past 100 years.  In fact, many remote highlands areas of Papua New Guinea made their first contact with white people from the outside world as recently as the 1930s.  A small group of prospectors were among the first people to make contact with isolated civilizations.  It had been thought that the geography of these areas presented such difficulty that people could not survive in the highlands.  This isolation of the peoples has led to the diversity in language, with Papua New Guinea having more than 826 separate languages.  These kids were fascinated by the very pale skin of the tourists on board the boat.  Although there was no ability to communicate with a mutual language, smiles, laughter, gestures and small gifts made interaction easy enough, and extremely enjoyable.  The villagers provided Dave with coconut and a delicious seaweed that went well together.  Dave entertained them with backflips of the stern and with his iPhone, which they used to take group selfies.  Kristy joked with one of the mothers as they all laughed at the ""kids"", including Dave and she shared her bag of candies with them.  While we can easily focus on the things that make us all different, it is equally important to focus on what makes us the same.  As these new friends demonstrate, laughter is the universal language.

Prep time: 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes soaking | Cooking time: 40 minutes SERVES Eight INGREDIENTS 200ml port 200ml red wine 2 broad strips lemon rind 100g granulated sugar 1 star anise 5cm piece cinnamon stick 4 fat pears, peeled, quartered and cored 200g fresh cranberries 75g dried cranberries 250g sponge cake 125ml port 500g good-quality fresh custard To finish 50ml port 25g dried cranberries 300ml double or whipping cream ½ tsp vanilla extract Icing sugar, to taste 2 tbsp roughly chopped toasted walnuts or hazelnuts METHOD Put the port, wine, 100ml water, lemon rind, sugar, star anise and cinnamon stick into a saucepan large enough to hold the quartered pears in a single layer.  Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for five minutes.  Add the pears and poach until they are tender – this can take anything from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on their ripeness – turning them over periodically.  Test with a fine skewer to check whether they are cooked.  If you can leave them soaking in the liquid overnight, they’ll darken and become even more fragrant.  Remove the pears with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl.  Discard the spices.  Make the cranberry mixture, allowing yourself plenty of time for it to cool.  Put the fresh and dried cranberries into a medium saucepan with the poaching liquor from the pears and bring to the boil.  Turn down the heat and simmer for about six minutes.  The liquid should be thick and syrupy, and about two-thirds of the cranberries will have popped.  Leave to cool completely.  You will end up with a rough purée.  Cut the sponge cake into slices.  Layer everything in a glass serving-bowl, soaking well in port as you go, starting with half of the sponge slices, then half of the pears, half the cranberry purée and half the custard.  Repeat so that you have two layers of each.  Cover with clingfilm and, if you wish, chill until the next day.  Bring the port and dried cranberries to the boil, and immediately take off the heat.  Leave to soak for 30 minutes, or until completely cool.  Drain.  Just before serving, whip the cream, and add the vanilla and icing sugar to taste.  Spread this over the top of the trifle and sprinkle on the nuts and the soaked cranberries. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cranberry-pear-port-trifle-recipe-144322799.html#bHuN549uC

There is great beauty and rich history, and only a few steps away, there is great poverty and hardship.  This is true for the animals here, as well as for the people and there are more than 5 million stray cows that wander the streets.  They seek food in composts and garbage bins and on vacant lots where a few blades of grass grow.  The cows are sacred to most of the people in India and their faith prohibits them from eating the meat of cows.  Impoverished farmers cannot afford to feed or care for the animals that they rely on for milk and the cows wander, eating what little they can find.  Unfortunately, cows often ingest garbage and plastic and their digestive tracts become blocked, causing them to become malnourished.  This prevents them from producing milk and they become more of a burden to the farmers than they can manage.  Farmers have little choice and they release the cows to fend for themselves.  The cows roam free, often relying on the kindness of strangers.  They are fed bread and table scraps by those who can afford to pass on some kindness for these gentle beasts.  This Canadian tourist has watched this dairy cow as she wanders, obviously looking for a meal.  She takes pictures of the unusual sight, but she cannot walk away without doing something to help.  She finds a nearby vendor who is selling alfalfa, a sweet grass that is high in protein and other nutrients.  She buys two large bunches and then goes back to find the cow in an alcove where it seems to spend the nights.  The cow is quite happy to munch away on the alfalfa and this kindly Canadian leaves the both bunches at her feet to be enjoyed at her own pace.  The dilemma in India continues to get worse as conditions for farmers get more unmanageable.  the number of stray cows increases constantly.  Many organizations collect donations to help provide the cows with food and a place to live so they will not suffer and present a hazard to motorists in the busy streets. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/kindly-tourist-shows-compassion-hungry-130003293.html#xHlqAeoq5

"" 36 Emily Ratajkowski's WFH flowIt may seem to some of us like we've been working from home forever, but back in the early days of the pandemic, there were still adjustments to be made.  Even the stars had to get used to it, and a lot of them took to lockdown orders by doing the same things the rest of us did: marathoning shows, eating junk, and spoiling our pets. ""Finished Love Is Blind (um, wow), ate two frozen pizzas w/ ranch, made calls from bed&took family selfies,"" model and writer Emily Ratajkowski captioned this family portrait.

She counts to ten before removing it from her nose and everything.  Future doctor? 45 Angela Kinsey is a real cat ladyLike Angela Kinsey's character on The Office, Angela Martin, she's all about her cats.  In one of the most memorable scenes of the series, Angela tosses one of her furry friends through the Dunder Mifflin ceiling, and it seems that the actor's cats tend to get in some compromising positions, too.  Case in point: This photo of Kinsey's cat, Oreo, who has moved into a dollhouse. ""The cats are in rare form today,"" she wrote in the caption.  ""I have found Oreo in the hall closet, on top of the pantry shelf and now this…"" 46 Jenny Mollen gets creative with her Elf on a ShelfThanks to the popularity of Elf on a Shelf, plenty of parents spend a good chunk of the holiday season posing these ubiquitous figurines.

""Wish I had listened. "" 48 Gabrielle Union's daughter isn't having itGabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade's daughter Kaavia didn't seem too thankful this Thanksgiving.  In this video from their family dinner, someone—probably her dad—reaches out to clean up her face with a napkin, and she couldn't possibly be more annoyed.  Even better? The fact that her shirt very clearly proclaims that she's ""not interested. "" 49 Chrissy Teigen won't drop this jokeThe joke that John Legend looks almost exactly like the animated aardvark Arthur is one that's been around a while, but no, Chrissy Teigen shows no signs of letting it go yet.

"" 50 Sebastian Stan pays tribute to Gossip GirlKnown more recently for his role of Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sebastian Stan isn't one to forget his roots—roots like playing Carter Baizen in the teen drama Gossip Girl.  The actor marked the September anniversary of the show's premiere by sitting down to the pilot with a glass of wine and logging his visceral reactions for Twitter.

Mona goes everywhere with Leptrone, and attended all of her classes and labs and other on-campus activities. At commencement, organizers gave Leptrone a small cap for Mona to wear during the event, but Leptrone told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she had no idea the university was going to recognize Mona until they awarded her an honorary dog-ree: her very own Bark-chelor of Science in Nursing. Leptrone, who has accepted a job as an intensive care unit nurse in Douglasville, Georgia, told the Journal-Constitution she thought it was wonderful that her school included Mona during the graduation festivities.

A normal race is just one lap long, and the piglets get a 10-minute break once they cross the finish line.

Finding a leopard mother and her cub in the wild is a priceless, once in a lifetime, experience.  I recently had the rare opportunity to film the adorable moments of a playful leopard cub, totally amused by its mother’s tail.  The leopard is one of the most elusive animals in the African bush.  This shy and solitary big cat is part of the so called Big five animals in Africa that also includes lion, buffalo, rhino and elephant.  The leopard is by far the most difficult to find and see.  The leopard relies on its camouflage and stealth to bring down prey that can range from mice to large antelope species.  It was during a recent safari in the Kruger National Park that we were lucky enough to come across a female leopard, lying alone in the sand of a dry riverbed.  We were absolutely ecstatic with our find.  We all whipped out our cameras and started filming and taking pictures.  It was not long before we were absolutely exhilarated by the fact that the female leopard had the most adorable cub.  Out of nowhere, the cute leopard cub appeared.  The appearance of the cub took us all by surprise and we couldn’t believe that we were actually sitting with two leopards in front of us.  Leopards are solitary predators and do not like to be seen.  If you are lucky enough to find a leopard in the wild, it will always be alone.  Only under rare circumstances will you get to see more than one leopard together such as this one with the mother and her cub and when a male and female meet up to mate.  The moments that followed between this leopard cub and its mother was filled with playfulness and motherly love.  When the leopard cub appeared from the bush, it was immediately interested in its mother’s tail.  It was so cute to watch how the cub’s hunting instincts was triggered by its mother’s moving tail.  Every time the female leopard would move her tail, the cub would playfully paw at her tail while trying to grab it.  This playful behaviour continued for a while until the cub became bored with its mother’s tail.  The leopard cub decided it was time to snuggle up against its mother before falling asleep.  We decided that we would not overstay our welcome and left the two leopards in peace. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cute-leopard-cub-loves-play-220012879.html#5lqBORhDj

Kathy Nuttle, who moved to Alaska with her family from New York eight years ago, was preparing a meal for a small gathering when she spotted the moose with her three babies on November 30.  The chances of multiple births, usually twins, increases when a moose cow is well-nourished and safe during pregnancy.  Triplets, however, are an extremely rare sighting.  Speaking about the video Kathy said: ""We looked out our kitchen window to see a moose mother with three babies - probably born May 2020.  ""Triplets are very rare, so I gathered my camera and went out to our back deck and took the video and several pictures.  ""We have moose in our yard often, but not a mother with three babies.

Between a pandemic, the ensuing economic depression and a little thing called Brexit looming over our heads, it's going to be tough to get into the merrymaking mood. But that's not to say you shouldn't give it a jolly good go.  After all, there's plenty to be cheerful about: a vaccine has started to roll out, Trump has been served his marching orders and, well, it's Christmas! Time to eat, drink and be merry.  It's what Prime Minister Hugh Grant would want (right after an inappropriately timed kiss from Martine McCutcheon, of course). One way to get yourself in the Christmas spirit is to fake it 'til you make it.  By which we mean making your house look as Christmassy as possible until the magic of the season begins to warm your cold, cold heart.  Tablescaping is an excellent way to do this.  Not only will a dreamy-looking table fill your support bubble with anticipation from the moment they step into the kitchen but a nice set of napkins and ornaments will go a long way to cover up the fact that you burned the turkey. So click through to find some super simple ideas to get your table looking Christmassy ahead of the big day.  Hopefully your Christmas cheer will follow.

The mission, to boldly go where no probe has gone before, will track and travel to an as-yet unidentified comet and map it in 3D for the first time.  Once in space the craft will lie in wait, potentially for years, until a cosmic candidate is spotted by astronomers on Earth.  From there it will set out to intercept it, deploying two smaller probes which will take readings and beam the data back to the main hub.  Though the process could only take a few hours, it is thought to shed light on the conditions in our universe more than four billion years ago.  The Telegraph understands that numerous countries applied to run the project and it is viewed by officials as a major coup for the UK scientific community.  Thales Alenia Space, a company with three sites in the UK and nearly 200 employees won the contract to design the mothership for the Comet Interceptor mission, with the two smaller probes made in Japan.  It is the first of the European Space Agency’s new class of “fast” missions where light equipment can hitchhike into space on an already scheduled launch.  This mission was originally proposed by a team led by UK academics from University College London and the University of Edinburgh.  Amanda Solloway, the science minister said: “The UK’s space industry is thriving and this out-of-this-world mission is testament to our world-leading expertise.  “I am very proud that scientists and engineers in Bristol and Harwell will be designing the Comet Interceptor spacecraft – their incredible work will not only further our understanding of the evolution of comets but help unlock the mysteries of the universe. ” Scientists are likely to target a comet from the Oort Cloud, a band of icy debris which lies between the sun and our next nearest star.  This cloud contains matter formed during the birth of our solar system, which will have been left intact as it has not been vaporised by rays from the sun.  This means that the probes will be able to study the composition of the comet to evaluate whether similar specimens may have brought water to Earth in the past.  Life on our planet could not exist without water, and it is thought by many that comets may have been responsible for bringing that water to our planet.  Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK said: “I am delighted ESA has once again placed its trust in our scientists and engineers at Thales Alenia Space in the UK who have excellent heritage from previous scientific missions such as Giotto and Rosetta.  “We all look forward to supporting this exciting and unprecedented scientific mission to uncover more information about the origins of our Universe. ”#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/britain-build-comet-chaser-spacecraft-184736082.html#qwAjDsZPT

Gunner, a four-month-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, was rescued from an alligator attack in October when his owner Richard Wilbanks jumped into a pond to save him. Video of the incident shows Wilbanks pulling an alligator’s jaws apart, freeing Gunner. Gunner was this week officially deputized as a member of the Lee County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Dogs program. “Do you swear to uphold the constitutional law for the Lee County Sheriff’s Office? This is a big day, OK.  You are going to be a detective now,” Sheriff Carmine Marceno said to Gunner while pinning a badge on his harness. The Deputy Dogs Pets on Patrol initiative “encourages pet owners to pay closer attention to suspicious activity while out with their pets and report concerns to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office,” the sheriff’s office says.

New calculations put the top of the world 86cm (34in) higher than previously recognised, measuring in at 8,848. 86m (29,032 feet).  The joint declaration by two national survey teams also settled a long disagreement between neighbouring China and Nepal on Everest's height.  Until this week, Nepal had judged the mountain to be 8,848m, while China considered it four metres lower.  Both sides decided to check the mountain's height after speculation that a 2015 earthquake in the region had shifted tectonic plates under Everest and global warming may have thinned snow caps.  Nepal had at first planned to conduct the measurement alone, but a joint project was convened under the banner of “eternal friendship” after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Himalayan nation in 2019.  Nepalese surveyors climbed the mountain more than a year ago to take new measurements, in the first such expedition by the nation.  Chinese surveyors made their ascent in May 2020, becoming the only team to reach the summit this year after the Covid-19 pandemic closed the mountain to climbers.  The teams used a mixture of GPS data and trigonometric calculations from lower mountains to make their new estimate. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mount-everest-grows-34-inches-123040037.html#t8sqYPHSs

Seeing baby animals in the African wild is always a special occasion.  It was during a safari in the Kruger National Park that this adorable moment between a lion cub and his father was captured.  It was like watching a possible real-life scene from the Lion King movie with Simba jumping on top of Mufasa, looking for attention.  We recently had incredible luck on our side during a safari when we came across a large pride of lions resting in the shade.  Lions are big sleepers and they can easily spend twenty hours of the day just sleeping, resting and doing absolutely nothing.  Part of the pride were three adorable cubs, clearly not looking to go to rest any time soon.  While the adults were sleeping, the cute lion cubs had other plans of their own.  I remembered as a child the trouble I got into for making a noise while my parents were trying to take their afternoon nap.  One male lion cub, who clearly had all the courage in the world or couldn’t care less, decided it was time to go and seek some attention from his father, a big male lion sleeping a short distance away from the rest of the pride.  The lion cub carefully approached the King of the Jungle, making us wonder how this whole ordeal was going to turn out.  What happened next totally amazed us.  The lion cub unexpectedly decided to climb on top of his father, curiously investigating his impressive mane.  Still there was not a single response coming from the big male lion.  The lion cub sat on top his father, looking very comfortable, thinking of what else he can do to get his father’s attention.  The cub decided to get down from his father and thought that cuddling with his father would do the trick.  Even after placing his paw on his father’s face, licking him a few times again after, the lion cub realized that he was not going to receive any sort of attention.  The cub turned around and started planning his next move while checking to see what was happening with the rest of the pride members.  At that very moment the big lazy male lion slowly turned onto his back and continued snoozing with his feet up in the air, acting as if nothing happened.  The cub was already so fixated on his new mission that he totally ignored his father and went back to play with the other two cubs.  Even though the male lion did not show any sort of response while his son looked for attention, we were amazed by the unconditional patience and acceptance the male lion showed towards his son.  With a paw the size of the cub’s head, the father could easily have sent his son flying in annoyance which has happened before.  In our opinion this was a sign of true fatherly love as we all knew the big male lion wasn’t really fast asleep all that time and he was well aware of what was going on the whole time. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lion-cub-adamantly-seeks-attention-220011355.html#9hsrOxinb

Theo, a one-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel, was clearly taken by surprise when encountering such an object for the first time as his owner, Haley Sutermeister, filmed the stand-off before posting the footage on Instagram. “This was his first encounter with a giant inflatable decoration, and he was certain he was protecting his mom and his brother, Joey, by growling at the decoration,” Sutermeister told Storyful.

Between throwing a literal tantrum every Sunday morning when my dad would forcefully pry me out of bed so that I wouldn’t be late for Hebrew school, and then never returning the temple again after I had a raging Bat Mitzvah, well. . .  I guess you could say my devotion to Judaism is pretty pathetic at best.  Do I fast on Yom Kippur? Of course not—the thought of giving up my morning cup of coffee because I’m “repenting” is simply out of the question.  However, just because you might not find me at the synagogue on a weekly or evenly quarterly basis doesn’t mean that I don’t love being Jewish.  In fact, I look forward to celebrating (and cooking for) most of the holidays, especially Hanukkah. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/hanukkah-game-buffalo-latkes-124300890.html#UrJjVZjJH

Marni Licursi recorded a video that showed a toy Santa ascending a toy ski lift and then sliding down the ski track around her Christmas tree.  The video clocked more than 750,000 views on TiKTok. Licursi told Storyful that the toy was called Mr Christmas Santa’s Ski Slope, which was purchased by her neighbor in 1992.  She stored the toy in her basement for a few years after her neighbor threw it out, she said.  This year, she decided to test out the 28-year-old decor. “I was thrilled when I discovered all the parts were in the box and it worked! It’s an incredible piece and I have been overwhelmed by all the love I have received from sharing it,” Licursi told Storyful.

Since his birth on May 1 the young giant panda stayed in the maternity pen with his mother Wu Wen.  The 14kg cub sleeps four fours between meals, followed by short and careful walks and long stretching exercises.  Zoologist José Kok says: ""As you could see, this is really the moment that he starts to eat bamboo.  In the beginning, it was only nibbling on it and playing with it, but now you can see that he starts to eat, and we only know if he eats as soon as there are pieces of bamboo in his poo of course, we didn't see that yet, but I think it will happen not far from here. "" Fan Xing's parents went to the Netherlands in 2017 from the panda rescue centre in China.  The bears were supposed to breed because there are not many giant pandas left in the wild.  ""You know, we are very eager to participate in breeding programmes and especially for the giant panda because the giant panda is the symbol for threatened nature.  So right from the beginning, when we started this project, it was our aim to get the pandas here and do the breeding.  Yes, but when the pandas arrived here, mum and dad, they were only three years old.  So we had to wait another three years before they were finally able to mate and get a cub,"" Kok says.  The young panda's name Fan Xing refers to Van Gogh's painting Starry Night.  Fan comes from Fan Gao, which means Van Gogh in Chinese, while Xing, which means star, and symbolises hope, is also a reference to the panda's father Xing Ya, meaning Elegant Star.  The mother's name Wu Wen means Beautiful Powerful Cloud.  Giant pandas are solitary animals.  The male panda Xing Ya lives in a separate enclosure.  It took a lot of time and creativity to bring the two together to mate.  Kok says: ""We always said we prefer the natural way, and we saw right from the beginning when the female is in oestrus, we had them close to each other.  Normally they live apart, but when she was in distress we would have them a little bit closer to each other, and we could see that, wow, they didn't hate each other, you know, and that was good news because if there was not this mix is good, good feeling between the two of them, you would never have a mating. "" Wu Wen now has at least a few years of rest before another breeding attempt is made.  In the wild, pandas do not often get pregnant, as the bears live solitary lives and females are only fertile for a few days each year.  The Ouwehands zoo in Rhene is the only zoo in the Netherlands where visitors can see giant pandas.  The zoo and the Chinese panda rescue centre made the deal giving the panda's family only a temporary home.  Kok knows the panda's time is limited.  She says: ""Well, the cub Fan Fan Xing, he can stay here until he's four years old and then he has to go back to China and really normally the cubs would stay with mum for about two years.  So we have to see how the relationship between these two develops.  And definitely, we're going to get them together again for another mating in the future. "" Wu Wen and Xing Ya will stay in the Netherlands for fifteen years. "#https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/panda-takes-first-steps-into-the-world/vi-BB1bHHOq#gomEg800s

If, for instance, you had one sensor that could detect toxic particles at a fraction of the concentration of that detectable by another, it would be a no-brainer to use the more sensitive of the two.

Lockdown stress has made me snappy and I’m on the brink of tears, when suddenly a streak of blond speeds past the kitchen window.  Our Labrador puppy, Herbie, is sprinting round the garden with the two metre long tree-protector tube in his mouth, looking like a triumphant burglar four-legging it from the animal police.  The sight is so silly I laugh, in spite of myself.  I’m reminded once again of the soothing powers of a pet during this pandemic.  Having bought Herbie in March, I am one of two million people in the UK who have become lockdown pet owners; demand for puppies in particular is so great that they have more than doubled in price.  Now, a new book reveals the extent to which pets have brought joy to us during these difficult times: Your Pet, Your Pill, by prominent vet Dr Margit Gabriele Muller, uses elucidating research and statistics to prove what pet owners have long suspected: their furry friends are good for their mental health.  “Pets reduce stress, depression, anxiety and pain,” explains Dr Muller, 52.  “This is especially true during lockdown when you are living in social isolation. ” Twenty years ago Dr Muller moved from her native Germany to the United Arab Emirates, where she became the state’s first female falcon vet.  She is also an NLP (neuro linguistic programming) coach and proud owner of 23 pets, including five dogs.  “I live alone, they are my family!” she laughs.  Her smiley demeanour is an advert in itself for her thesis.  Yet hers are arguments I would once have scoffed at.  Despite my husband Chris’s protestations otherwise, I long believed that dogs were too smelly and slobbery to be a part of our lives.  But, while research by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home published yesterday suggests nearly a third of new pet owners bought an animal “on impulse”, ours was more of a slow burn.  Three years ago, desperate to leave London, I decided to cut him a deal – if he let us move to the countryside, I would grant him his lifelong ambition of becoming a dog owner.  After that, my attitude shifted.  Partly because rural living made the prospect of a puppy more enticing; partly because our daughter Rosie, nine, and son, Felix, seven, were increasingly enamoured by the idea – but mostly because, after leaving the capital in July 2018, the incessant daily reminders that we were due a dog became too irritating to ignore.  When I saw the friend of a friend who breeds puppies looking for a home for Herbie, their beautiful blond Labrador, it felt like a sign.  Chris was about to start working from home, all future plans were scrapped.  If not now, when? The first thing nine-week-old Herbie did on arriving in our house was poop on the carpet.  It quickly became clear, however, that he injected happiness into our Covid-cramped lives.  I was surprised to discover that even just stroking his tiny body made me feel calmer.  Dr Muller says caressing a dog or other pet provides exactly the same health benefits as skin-on-skin contact with another human.  She cites a study from Australia’s Monash University that found after three minutes of cuddling, levels of oxytocin – the “love” hormone that helps bonding – increase, while a report in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research found five minutes of cuddles increases levels of the well-being and happiness hormones endorphin and dopamine.  “They are the same hormones released as when you’re breastfeeding or cuddling a partner,” says Dr Muller.  On the rare occasions Herbie wasn’t sleeping during those early weeks, the children built him obstacle courses out of brooms, taught him to “twerk” and humoured his non-stop demands for tummy tickles – their obsession with their new pet so all-consuming they often forgot they were under virtual house arrest. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/thought-dogs-were-slobbery-smelly-121133967.html#aaYAolBdA

Meadow became lost in the woods in Andes, New York, last month, and her owners, Gary and Debbie Morgan, quickly plastered flyers everywhere and spread the word online.  That's how James learned about the search efforts and decided to get involved.  ""Everybody's got the capability to help,"" he told World News Tonight.  ""You never know what will come of it. ""James headed to the woods and flew his drone up above the trees, looking closely at the images being captured by the device.  As soon as he saw a patch of white, James zoomed in and saw that it was a dog.  He ran to the area, and was greeted by Meadow, who was uninjured and thrilled to see him after 10 days on her own. Meadow was reunited with the Morgans right before Thanksgiving, and Debbie told World News Tonight her family was ""just so grateful for Brian for showing up when he did and being able to rescue her.

The underwater world is filled with beauty and wonder.  Unusual structures and corals line the bottom of the ocean, creating a landscape that is beautiful beyond description, and the animal life is equally breath taking.  Dolphins are among the most fascinating of all the ocean's creatures.  They are graceful and quick, often appearing for only a moment as they swim past scuba divers.  But occasionally, they are curious enough to venture close to check out the humans that must appear so awkward and clumsy to them.  These divers entered the water in the remote area around Darwin Island in the Galapagos, hoping to see hammerheads and whale sharks, along with any other animals.  They were surprised and thrilled to be surrounded by a large pod of dolphins that were slowly moving through the area.  The playful antics of the dolphins and the inquisitive looks delighted the divers as the pod stayed with them over a minute or two before moving on.  The squeaks and squeals of the dolphins communicating can clearly be heard in this video as the dolphins check them out.  One of the most intelligent creatures on the planet, dolphins are also one of the most loved.  Their faces seem to be set in a permanent smile.  For many, a close up encounter with a dolphin is one of their ultimate dreams.  These lucky scuba divers were fortunate to actually see these beautiful animals in their natural habitat, on their own terms. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/scuba-divers-themselves-surrounded-curious-220008482.html#zMruq36Ge

Footage by Save Giraffes Now (a Texas-based nonprofit that teamed up with Kenya Wildlife Service and the Northern Rangelands Trust to carry out the complicated rescue mission) shows giraffe Asiwa being brought from the flooded island to her new home at a Ruko Community Wildlife Conservancy sanctuary. The animals are part of a group of Rothschild’s giraffes that were sent to the remote Kenyan Rift Valley in 2011 in an effort to save the animals from poachers and to increase the subspecies’ population, People reported. According to reports, the eight giraffes ended up isolated after recent heavy rains turned the peninsula they were living on into an island. Asiwa was the first giraffe to cross the water on the barge, and a second giraffe named Pasaka has since been rescued. “There is great urgency to execute this rescue,” said David O’Connor, president of Save Giraffes Now.  “We couldn’t have asked for a better result, and we’re eager to move the others soon.  With giraffes undergoing a silent extinction, every one we can protect matters. ” Credit: Tyler Schiffman & Ami Vitale/Save Giraffes Now via Storyful#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rescue-crew-uses-steel-barge-180214463.html#2MF6Eqo6W

2020-12-04 02:24:16#sport#10 Great Movie Santas, from Kurt Russell to Paul Giamatti (Photos)#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/10-great-movie-santas-kurt-022416223.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YcP_SMbtSEzn5FHnOCgv1g--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/36d8d8e6de3a8f2283c36ec284026fb1#en#1.0#www.yahoo.com#As the embodiment of kindness, generosity, and Yuletide beneficence, Santa Claus presents some mighty big black boots, much less a red suit, for any actor to fill.  But jolly old Saint Nicholas has appeared in the movies for as long as the movies have existed, and here are some of our favorite actors who’ve steered the sleigh (not counting Billy Bob Thornton and anyone else who has played a guy who is pretending to be Santa):Kurt Russell in “The Christmas Chronicles” (2018) and “The Christmas Chronicles 2” (2020): There’s more than a little bit of Russell’s trucker character from “Big Trouble in Little China” in his take on Father Christmas, but that blue-collar bravado and dad-bod energy make this character, in the words of critic Nathan Rabin, “a Santa who f–ks. ”Jim Broadbent, “Arthur Christmas” (2011): In this delightful animated adventure from Aardman, Broadbent plays the current Santa in a long lineage: He assumed the reins from his father (voiced by Bill Nighy), and is about to pass them along to son Steve (Hugh Laurie), who has modernized the toy delivery system, reducing Santa to a dotty figurehead.  As voiced by Broadbent, he’s a bit of a dodderer, but still very much in love with the job. Paul Giamatti, “Fred Claus” (2007): Vince Vaughn has the title role of the main man’s ne’er-do-well brother, but this spotty comedy is stolen outright by Giamatti, who displays a level of kindness and joy that he rarely gets to exercise in front of the camera.  The fatsuit and white beard fit the veteran character actor like a fur-trimmed glove. Ed Asner, “Elf” (2003): There’s not an ounce of cynicism or irony to this modern classic.  Asner, whose Lou Grant character once famously growled that he “hate[d] spunk,” must now rely upon the good will and Christmas spirit of New Yorkers when his sleigh gets stranded in Central Park — thankfully, the actor generates enough holiday cheer to ensure a happy outcome. Tim Allen, “The Santa Clause” (1994): Transforming from a divorced businessman to the Big Red Cheese himself, Allen is funny and relatable as a regular guy who finds himself literally expanding to fit the iconic red suit.  So often in Santa movies, the audience must go on the “oh wow, he’s really real after all” journey, and Allen makes the perfect guide, with his character evolving from cynical to sweet as he completes his metamorphosis into the North Pole’s most famous resident. Douglas Seale, “Ernest Saves Christmas” (1988): Another comedy about the Santa title changing hands features veteran British character actor Seale as a Kringle on the verge of retirement, traveling to Florida to transfer the gig to a kind-hearted kids’ TV host.  For all the wacky slapstick afoot, Seale maintains his dignity, presenting a Santa who’s both capable of genuine magic while also very much a part of the real world — a tricky balance in any movie, much less one built around Jim Varney’s rubber-faced (and, admittedly, hilarious) antics. David Huddleston, “Santa Claus: The Movie” (1985): You’d think the guy playing the title role would be the star, but poor Huddleston (“The Big Lebowski”) had to settle for billing beneath Dudley Moore (as an inventive elf) and John Lithgow (devouring the scenery as a corrupt toy magnate).  Still, as overblown (and filled with product placement) as this shrill Christmas epic can be, Huddleston brings genuine warmth to the proceedings, whether he’s a 14th-century woodcutter determined to deliver toys to local children or the man with the bag spanning the globe every December 24. John Call, “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians” (1964): A kiddie adventure so terrible that “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” Cinematic Titanic and Rifftrax could all goof on it without repeating any jokes, this infamous Christmas turkey nonetheless features Broadway veteran Call (before making this movie, he appeared in the original cast of “Oliver!”) giving us a twinkly-eyed, rosy-cheeked Santa who seems to have stepped out of a Norman Rockwell lithograph.  His “Ho ho ho!” always sounds genuine, even when he’s facing off with antenna-sporting green aliens bearing Wham-O Air Blasters. José Elías Moreno, “Santa Claus” (1959): Unless you grew up watching Mexican television or going to kiddie matinees in the Southwest in the 1960s and early ’70s, you were probably exposed to this trippy import via “Mystery Science Theater 3000. ” And while this film earned the mockery it received from Mike and the bots, it’s one of those bad movies that’s so utterly enthralling that you can’t stop watching it.  Even though this Santa teams up with Merlin to fight the devil (long story), Moreno gives us a memorable Saint Nick, even when the actor dubbing him into English makes his laugh sound sinister. Edmund Gwenn, “Miracle on 34th Street” (1947): The only actor to win an Oscar for playing Santa Claus, and it’s definitely a case where the Academy got it right.  Gwenn’s Kris Kringle saves the Macy’s parade from a drunken impostor, generates publicity for the department store by alerting customers about better deals being offered by competitors, enchants a young Natalie Wood into believing in magic, and even proves his sanity at a court hearing.  With a performance like this, who wouldn’t believe in Santa? (Honorable mention: Sir Richard Attenborough in the 1994 remake, who’s lovely but can’t hold a candle to the OG. )Read original story 10 Great Movie Santas, from Kurt Russell to Paul Giamatti (Photos) At TheWrap#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/10-great-movie-santas-kurt-022416223.html#VO1XdQnqQ

Jamie Frost, a teacher from Tiffin School in Kingston, received a special recognition from the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize for helping young people to learn from home during the Covid-19 crisis.  He won the £34,000 ""Covid hero"" prize for running a free maths tuition website during the pandemic in a ceremony hosted by Stephen Fry.  Ranjitsinh Disale, 32, who teaches in a village primary school in western Maharashtra state, won the $1m (£750,000) award for using QR codes and other innovative teaching techniques in his lessons, which were credited with reducing student drop-out rates.  Mr Disale arrived at the school - which is wedged between a cattle shed and a storeroom - in the drought-prone village in 2009.  With few resources, he took on the challenge of specially learning the local language Kannada in order to translate textbooks.  Mr Disale also redesigned the textbooks, embedding them with QR codes to give students access to audio poems, video lectures, stories and to set them homework.  Mr Disale's school was the first in Maharashtra to introduce QR codes, and after he submitted a proposal regarding their efficacy to the state education authorities 2017, the government introduced QR-coded schoolbooks across the province for all grades.  His enthusiasm led to the 100 per cent attendance of girls in classrooms, in an area where girls commonly drop out of school after getting married.  He also provides online science lessons to students in 83 countries and oversees an international project building associations between young people living in conflict zones.  Mr Disale’s decision to share half his prize money with the remaining nine teacher finalists will mean over £41,000 will be given to educators from Brazil, Italy, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, the US and Vietnam.

The cookie maker has partnered with none other than Lady Gaga to bring you limited-edition Chromatica Oreos.  Featuring a pink wafer shell stuffed with bright green creme, this cookie is unlike anything you've ever seen Oreo do before. The pink and green Oreos are named after the Grammy Award–winning artist's sixth studio album Chromatica, which was released in May of this year.  Besides the colorful update, the cookies will also be etched with brand-new designs reminiscent of the album's cover art—all in the service of transporting fans to ""the world of Chromatica, where kindness rules all things,"" according to Gaga herself.  (Related: McDonald's Is Making These 8 Major Upgrades. )⚔️ LADY GAGA x @OREO x Chromatica 💓 Dropping soon! pic. twitter. com/Gtd5qeZXZi— Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) December 2, 2020""Together with Lady Gaga, we cannot wait to unleash her world of Chromatica on our Oreo cookie and encourage fans to spread musical messages of kindness to create a brighter and more connected country,"" Justin Parnell, senior director of Oreo, said in a press release. The limited-edition release will be followed up with a ""Sing It With Oreo"" campaign, which encourages fans to send musical messages to loved ones for a chance to win an assortment of Lady Gaga swag and experiences. Six-packs of the cookies will drop in January everywhere where Oreos are sold, and they'll be around while supplies last (which may not be long at all).  A release date for full-size packs hasn't yet been announced—but worry not.  You can sign up for the Lady Gaga x Oreo Stan Club to get notified as soon as they drop.  Plus, the first 1,000 people to sign up will get a complimentary cookie pack when they're released.

Following you will see this deep connection between 18 month old Harvey and his dog, Bella.  Bella is a 5 year old Terrier mix pup from Surrey British Columbia, Canada.  Bella has great parents that up until a years and half ago she was the main ""child"" in the home.  Bella was very use to receiving all the attention until her little ""brother"" Harvey came along.  Bella has always been an extremely friendly and lovable pup.  She has always been able to get along with anyone, and any other dogs, making it great for taking her along on vacation and to even just the local dog parks.  Now that Harvey is very mobile, he is also building an extremely lovable personality.  His love doesn’t only include his parents, with hugs and kisses daily, Harvey also loves his dog.  Here you will see just how much love Harvey has for Bella.  Yes most kids love animals and pets, but Harvey goes and shows to the extreme.  Climbing into bed with Bella on her favourite dog bed is only one place that she gets cuddles from her brother .  Whether on the couch curled in a ball, trying to sleep, Harvey will always snuggle up to Bella to comfort her and show his love.  Rolling around on the dog bed, snuggling and hugging Bella, Harvey at times gets a little “heavy “ on this little pooch and she will escape his grappling for a quieter location.  Harvey always finds Bella, he loves her to bits.  As you can see there is nothing more special than the love of a young child and his dog.  What a beautiful relationship these two have, true love.

The species is characterised by its small stature, spindly legs and mouse-like head, and the birth is of particular significance because there are only a dozen chevrotains in European zoos and just one male.  “For the first time ever in the history of any species of mouse deer, an actual birth was filmed and then the first moment of life of the baby,” Radoslaw Ratajszczak, the head of Zoo Wroclow, told Reuters.  Chevrotains are facing extinction due to hunting and to palm oil plantations in their native home. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rare-mouse-deer-born-camera-173153398.html#GgqVnPMSH

Jennifer Gibson captured footage of the mesmerizing moment from her living room.  Her seven-year-old son can be heard talking briefly before he’s hushed by Gibson and her husband for fear they may be disturbing the moose family’s “private moment. ”Speaking to Storyful, Gibson said, “It was early in the morning, before the sun was up, and my family and I were having a quiet Sunday morning when we noticed the moose outside in our yard. ”After spotting the animals, the family watched for approximately a “half-hour” through their living room window as the pair ate grass and played in their front yard.  Later in the morning, two more moose showed up on their property and the mother chased them away, according to Gibson. She added, “I took many pictures and videos of these moose … It was a magical morning for us and a rare event to see the moose so up close and personal. ” Credit: Jennifer Gibson via Storyful#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/magical-morning-moose-calf-nuzzles-183249121.html#7jGUmv8rN

Succumb to football fever, Argentina As the outpouring of grief over the death of Diego Maradona confirms, to say that the Beautiful Game is an obsession in Argentina would be a huge understatement.  So passions will be soaring in June and July as the country co-hosts the Copa América, with La Albiceleste vying to capture the trophy.  Follow the fans between stadiums in Buenos Aires, nearby La Plata and Mendoza, where you can also kick back with a silky malbec in a chic winery.  Finish with roars even louder than a cup-final crowd at the world’s largest waterfall system, thunderous Iguazú.  A 13-day, football-focused itinerary with Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; journeylatinamerica. co. uk) costs from £3,465pp tailor-made, including flights and excursions such as a tour of Boca Juniors’ legendary home stadium, La Bombonera.  Tournament match tickets on request.  2.  Pack your polo gear, Argentina From Paraguay through the Pampa to Patagonia, rural culture revolves around the horse.  Playing gaucho is one way to immerse yourself; another is polo, a quintessential Argentine pastime.  You’ll find opportunities for both at traditional country estancias (cattle ranches) such as Los Potreros in the Sierra Chicas south of Córdoba.  Or try a two-hour polo taster on the outskirts of Buenos Aires at the grand mock-Tudor Estancia Villa Maria.

A United Nations report has cautioned that greenhouse gas emissions due to human activity are at a record high, “with no signs of slowing down. ” Many nations are recording weather extremes, higher average temperatures and rising seas.  Meanwhile, the first wave of increasing numbers of climate refugees points to how a changing environment will reshape human life.  The changes in climate may have been caused by previous and current generations of adults, but it is the future generations that will have to deal with its worst effects.  Today’s children will play a critical role in protecting the environment.  Confronting the crisis will require much change – and education is an urgent first step. As experts have said, this education will need to start early, so that environmentally friendly practices become habits at a young age.  Taiwan offers an example of how to teach children about caring for their environment.  Environmental attitudes in TaiwanBy the early 1990s, rapid economic development had led to environmental degradation in Taiwan, an island in the China Sea and home to nearly 24 million people.  The air quality in the cities was hazardous, a third of rivers were polluted and garbage often didn’t make it to landfills.  Today, however, the Taiwanese take pride in their island’s natural beauty – from coastal wetlands to lush green mountains – and in their success in protecting the environment.  Taiwan is especially known for its high rates of recycling and elaborate sorting systems that even include a category for food waste destined for pig slop.  According to self-reported figures, Taiwan now recycles 20% more than the U. S.  – and any visitor can attest to the seriousness of recycling efforts. As a scholar of Chinese Buddhism, I have been looking at how religious groups address contemporary issues, including environmentalism, in children’s literature.  Teaching childrenIn Taiwan, over a third of adults identify themselves as Buddhist, more than any other religion, making it a significant cultural force.  Buddhist groups have been at the forefront of efforts to care for the environment.  Included in their effort is Buddhist literature for children that reflects environmental concerns.  Picture books on this topic take two approaches: In one, bodhisattvas – wise and powerful supernatural beings that can appear in the world to help human beings – serve as models for children in the way that they protect the environment. For example, in the book, “Samantabhadra Bodhisattva’s Great Battle against the Trash Monster,” published by the Buddhist organization Dharma Drum Mountain, the first page of the story introduces a bodhisattva who wants to transform the polluted world into one that is pure. This bodhisattva meets a young boy who says he has nightmares about a monster made out of trash.  As it turns out, the monster has been appearing because the boy’s room is a messy mountain of garbage.  When he cleans it up, the bodhisattva prompts him to properly sort everything he throws away, reflecting real practices.  Then the little boy decides to become a “little pioneer of world environmentalism,” and accompanies the bodhisattva in cleaning up parks and beaches.  In this story, the little boy’s concerns grow from his own room to the bigger world, with the bodhisattva modeling compassionate action.  Historically, bodhisattvas have been invoked to help people in times of extreme need (such as a storm at sea), and intervening for the good of the environment updates their role for contemporary times. In this case Buddhism is central to the story, and cleaning polluted spaces becomes a metaphor for spiritual purification.  The reader looks to a bodhisattva or Buddha as guide, and is inspired to take action.  Caring for the environmentBut in other cases, Buddhist organizations do not use figures like bodhisattvas to teach about environmentalism.  The stories do not feature bodhisattvas as characters, and the narratives may not be obviously Buddhist, but offer environmental education in the context of a broader Buddhist education.  Being a well-rounded Buddhist, in other words, means knowing and respecting the environment. They may use stories about plants and animals to teach children about such things as the life cycle of coal and symbiotic relationships between animals, like that of rhinoceroses and oxpeckers, which are popularly thought to eat ticks and other insects, though the reality is more complex. Children learn about biology and how living beings are interconnected.  This lends itself to thinking holistically about the environment, and these stories often prompt children to look at the world from the perspective of other living beings.  Published by a major Buddhist organization, the book “Record of the Wanderings of a Plastic Bag” goes a step farther in presenting other perspectives. A plastic bag starts out as plaything for a baby, then becomes a place for the cat to nap.  The family’s grandfather claims it to collect tomatoes, and when he is finished, he washes the bag and hangs it to dry.  A bit later, he uses it to carry worn-out shoes to be repaired, at which point the bag blows away.  It travels joyfully on the wind accompanied by a leaf and a candy wrapper, but is eventually swept up into a garbage bag.  A dog rips open the garbage, and the bag blows away again, only to be picked up by a child with a stick who treats it as a toy.  After it is abandoned by the child – very sadly for the bag – it is picked up, recycled and transformed into shopping bag.  This is a happy ending, reflected by the bag’s happy smile. The author, Liu Rugui, writes that she used the bag as a character in the hope of stimulating children’s compassion, leading them to cherish the objects that they use.  “Cherishing,” according to Liu, leads to a deeper understanding of environmentalism.  There is connection between being able to take the perspective of a plastic bag –entailing both intellectual and emotional responses – and valuing that object, which otherwise might be seen as a piece of trash. Young readers are prompted to take the perspective of these nonhuman characters, changing how they think about the world and their own actions.  This connects to the Buddhist teachings of karma and reincarnation, which mean that every intentional action has a consequence.  Equally important, although one couldn’t be reborn as a plastic bag, one could be reborn as an insect or endangered animal.  On another level, taking the perspective of a plastic bag helps readers to understand how all elements of the universe are interconnected, a teaching that takes its most sophisticated philosophical form in Huayan Buddhism.  Impact of children’s literatureBy showing children that they have responsibility in caring for the environment, these books work to produce what sociologist Bengt Larsson has called, in a 2012 paper, “ecological selves. ”Although studies on the long-term effects of children’s literature are limited, there’s some evidence that this approach is effective in fostering concern and care for environmental issues.  [Deep knowledge, daily.  Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter. ]For example, a study in Australia found that anthropomorphism, which attributes human traits to animals and things, increased children’s concern for parts of the environment, as did their emotional investment in the stories.  That is, certain types of books do seem to change children’s attitudes.  As I found in my research, this is something Buddhist organizations recognize as well and incorporate into their educational mission.  Growing up Buddhist means growing into environmentalism and global citizenship.

Installed in one of Kyiv's residential areas at the end of October, the reimagined vending machine has collected almost 320,000 pounds of recyclables within the first two weeks, according to the project founder Rufat Raimov.  “A lot of people come here, but mainly over the weekends after they collect plastic bottles during the weekdays.  You can see it yourself that families come here during the weekends.  Parents give a bag to kids and kids puts bottles into a machine one by one.  Over the weekends, machine attracts a lot of people.  In a workday, we collect 2-3 bags of bottles while over the weekend day we collect at least six bags. "" He’s proud that the initiative helps to tackle two problems in the capital - recycling plastic waste and nourishing stray animals.  One plastic bottle equals 20 grams of food dispersed by the machine onto a pet bowl.  Another bowl placed near can also be filled with water by any customer.  ""We have regular customers.  They tell us: ""It is our ritual. "" A kid collects bottles and then comes up to parents saying: ""Let's go and feed animals. "" To raise a socially responsible generation is our main advantage. "" Raimov has already teamed up with a Ukrainian charity for the initiative and hopes to expand the project by installing more machines in Ukraine - as well as new ones placed indoors.

Hansberger said her uncle had built her a “squirrel picnic table” in April but, moments after she placed it outside, it caught the attention of the chipmunk. In the following days, Hansberger continued to put out fruits and vegetables for Thelonious, who kept coming back for more. Hansberger then got creative, dressing up the table with different themes that Thelonious appeared eager to examine. This video shows Thelonious enjoying what Hansberger described as a “festive lunch in a colorful wonderland,” while surrounded by tiny artificial Christmas trees. While Hansberger hopes her efforts bring Thelonious a little happiness every day, she said his visits are doing the same for her. “He has given me a lot of joy and eased a lot of anxiety about the pandemic, loss of work, and the wild election,” Hansberger told Storyful.

In footage shared on November 25 by his mother, Jaclyn Vozniak, Zeke dribbles two basketballs while walking backwards on the treadmill, ably dribbling the ball through his legs while also executing 360-degree turns. Jaclyn explained to Storyful, “When he walked into his great-grandmother’s garage he noticed a treadmill.  He was ecstatic since he hasn’t had any treadmill access since the coronavirus started and he missed dribbling on it. ”Unfortunately, he didn’t have any basketballs. “So, Zeke’s dad went to Walmart and purchased two basketballs,” Vosniak added. After filming the video, both basketballs were left at his 93-year-old grandmother’s home in North, Augusta, where he can use them in future for more unorthodox basketball drills.

Drone pilot Travis Middleton captured footage of cownose rays swimming amongst several sharks near a pier that recently experienced weather damage. Speaking to Storyful, Middleton said he was flying his drone along the Gulf Coast to record the aftermath of the Hurricane Sally when he saw the rays, swimming near the Gulf State Park Pier on September 30. “I had heard about the migration in the past and always wanted to capture it but had no idea it would be happening when I was shooting that day,” he said. He added, “For the first time flying my drone I felt a little nervous just because it was such an overwhelming thing to see.  It was truly one of the more beautiful things I have had the chance to capture. ”Although stingray sightings are common near Alabama’s shores.  Middleton wrote on Twitter that he never witnessed a stingray migration before seeing it on the “screen” of his drone remote. Cownose rays can be found along the Gulf of Mexico.  Changes to their migration patterns can often be triggered by seasonal changes to water temperature and sun orientation, according to experts.

Mare than 20 historic shipwrecks from a long ago time lay on the bottom, inviting adventurous scuba divers to venture beneath the waves to explore them.  Wooden steamships with massive boilers that propelled them over the lakes with their cargo were once commonly used to deliver food, building materials, and other products between cities and even between Canada and the United States of America.  The five Great Lakes are among the largest bodies of fresh water in the world, created during the ice age when glaciers carved paths and left rivers and lakes behind when they melted.  Lake Huron is situated on the Canada/U. S.  border and it's northern shore is Georgian Bay, almost as large as the rest of the lake itself.  The tiny, but picturesque town of Tobermory is a popular place to visit, especially for those who seek an opportunity to scuba dive in cold, but crystal clear conditions.  The visibility is a blessing because there is a lot to see near Tobermory.  This is where marine Fathom Five National Marine Park is located.  Famous for the Flowerpot Island with it's unique structures towering high above the shore, land adventurers also flock to the area for sightseeing and pictures.  The 420 million year old dolomite has been worn by the weather and waves to create mysterious caves and structures both above and beneath the water.  But Fathom Five holds the allure that brings scuba divers from around the world to visit more than 20 old wrecks that have been surprisingly well preserved in the icy depths.  Wooden beams, rudders, boilers and ship hardware are on the lake's bottom, just as they were when the wrecks came to rest after their destruction.  A few of the wrecks have actually been placed intentionally to create interesting dive sites for exploration.  Such is the case with this ship, the Caroline Rose which was built in the 1940s in Nova Scotia, Canada.  Originally sunk by mishap, it was towed to its current location to make it accessible for scuba enthusiasts.  A trip to Tobermory holds something for everyone.  Summer scuba diving events are held by Float n' Flag Dive Centre in Burlington for those looking to investigate this area and the wonders it holds. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/crystal-clear-waters-canadas-great-130009120.html#UPzpHlP9z

I've also just bought a nice wirework set of shelves from antique shop Branching Out that I'll stock with potted herbs, so I don't spend winter evenings playing hide and seek in the garden.  We all know and love evergreen bay, rosemary, thyme and sage, but there are other herbs that will sit out the winter's cold and bring cheer and flavour.  So ring the changes and sing the praises of myrtle, hyssop and winter savoury.  There's a whole world of hearty flavours in the herb garden.  We just need the time and confidence to try them.  Myrtle With warmer winters, myrtle (Myrtus communis) should be planted more frequently.  Its small baylike leaves smell lovely, so pot it in well-drained gritty compost, and place by the front door to enjoy each time you pass.  With small fragrant cream flowers full of furry golden stamens, pinkish stems and pretty blue/black berries, it's a plant for all seasons.  Herb expert Jekka McVicar tells me it's one of her favourite herbs: ""I harvest myrtle berries in November to make myrtle, rather than sloe gin.  It has a warm spicy flavour, ideal for Christmas.  The leaves can be used in stews and soups, are especially good with pork and game, and would be excellent in pork sausages,"" she says.  Keep myrtle cosy under the eaves of your house, wrapped in fleece if the temperatures really plummet and away from bitter wind and wet.  The variety 'Tarentina' is more compact, and 'Variegata' has silvery leaves that look good with the pink-tinged creamy flowers.  Hyssop Hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis) is a dense hardy perennial and member of the mint family, native of the sunny Mediterranean.  In tiny quantities it's delicious with fish, meat and vegetables.  A holy herb, traditionally it was hung in homes to protect from the evil eye, and was used to flavour absinthe.  Tisanes made with the leaves and sweetened with honey will soothe a seasonal sore throat.  With bright blue flower spikes, it looks good edging the beds of the herb garden.

Pear sorbet, pear crumble, poached pears, pear trifle, pear tart… the list goes on.  A few years ago, when I took on private chef jobs on my days off from Llewelyn’s restaurant in south London, I came across a chef who stuffed pears full of amaretti biscuits, sloshed over some sherry and baked them.  They were so unbelievably delicious.  I thought about those pears a lot and would make iterations of them at all the restaurants I worked at during pear season.  The version I’m sharing today has added chopped chocolate and diced marzipan.  And even though I’m not normally a sherry fan, using it here with the pears works wonderfully.  I made these recently for some friends who claimed to dislike both sherry and marzipan, and they were instantly won over.  I hope you will be, too.  Chocolate and sherry baked pears These pears, while being very low effort and quick to assemble, are full of flavour and really moreish.  Perfect on their own or with ice cream.

Jen Cantwell Weiss from Ogden shared footage on November 15 showing a delivery driver struggling to get up the steps of her home as he dropped off groceries.  “I didn’t watch this video til after he was already gone, or else I would have gone out to help him,” she wrote on Facebook.  A relative of the man saw the footage and put him in touch with Weiss. Weiss discovered the man, named Larry, is a veteran who suffered a stroke earlier in 2020 and had to relearn how to walk.  Weiss shared his story on Facebook, saying he took the delivery job to pay for repairs to his roof, and appealed for people to help him with the costs. Weiss posted his Venmo information and the donations started to roll in, she said.  “I have been in touch with him and he is overwhelmed with gratitude,” she wrote on Facebook.  “He did NOT ask for any help, but I love that people are touched by his story and want to help lighten his load a bit. ”Larry told local media that the donations covered his roof repairs and he no longer had to do deliveries. Weiss shared an update on Facebook, saying Larry and his wife “requested that rather than continuing to donate to him, you donate to Toys for Tots or your local food bank.  He says he has received more than enough and feels there are so many others out there who need the help more than he does. ”“He expresses his heartfelt gratitude for everything people have sent,” Weiss wrote.

According to Google Trends data, they have been, unsurprisingly, the most popular side dish for American Thanksgiving. Mashed potatoes are, however, invariably a supporting player behind more muscular turkeys, prime ribs, roast chicken, and anything that might come with a bowl of gravy.  Jamie Oliver invites you to rethink the possibilities. The ever-popular British cook catapulted to international prominence as the Naked Chef in the late ’90s.   Now, he might be known as the Data Chef.  In his new cookbook, 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week (Flatiron Books; $35), Oliver worked with major supermarkets across the U. K.  to determine the ingredients consumers buy most. “My dream was to try and write the most accessible cookbook I’ve ever written,” says Oliver via a phone interview.  What that means, he adds, is considering what people have on hand, as well as cost, variety, and of course, flavor.  “I used data to drive this creation.  It’s not glamorous, and I don’t typically like it, but it’s fascinating.  We were churning through thousands of items at major supermarkets.  I wanted to study food that most of us buy every week. ”From his research, Oliver determined 30 of the most popular foods purchased at supermarkets.  He then selected 18 to feature in his book—seven different ways, per the title—with the goal of staving off boredom for home cooks whose supermarket habits are on repeat.  They’re all obvious and accessible: salmon, chicken breasts, avocado, shrimp.  His steak chapter, for instance, includes South American-styled chimichurri, a Chinese stir-fry with ginger, and a pepper-crusted number with whisky sauce. Likewise, Oliver’s potato chapter ranges from Indian-accented baked potatoes to a potato “lasagna” (aka gratin) made by layering slices in a creamy cheese sauce.  Most compelling is his savory pie with a mashed potato “crust. ”“I pair spring onions and tomatoes with oozy cheese to create the perfect flavor contrast with the soft, creamy mash—which also has a pleasingly crispy outer edge,” says Oliver.  In fact, the dish radiates comfort.  Oliver calls for two kinds of cheddar in his dish, but it’s wide open to interpretation.  “Feel free to mix up the cheese, based on what you’ve got. ” The most important part is the golden potato crust.  While mashed potatoes feature as a topping for such classics as shepherd’s pie and moussaka, it’s not so common to find them working as the bottom layer, too.  Though it’s firm enough to cut into slices, the pie could double as a dressed-up casserole.  You could just spoon it onto plates in one gorgeous pile.  The tomatoes add a refreshing bite but they’re not necessary.  Hot sauce makes a great addition, if you’re so inclined. Even as everyone is scaling down this year’s Thanksgiving feast, it’s hard not to overestimate how much mashed potatoes you’ll want.  Leftovers are inevitable—and now, very welcome.  “This one is perfect if you’ve made a bumper batch of mash,” says Oliver, and then shouts: “Happy holidays!” The following recipe is adapted from 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week, by Jamie Oliver. Testers Note: This recipe works best with drier mashed potatoes, ones made without excessive milk and butter.  Of course, that’s not what most people want for Thanksgiving.  If you have extra creamy mashed potatoes, cook them down so they’re as dense as possible.  Mash in an additional boiled potato or two, if you have them.  If you have less mashed potato, you can make this pie in a smaller baking dish, with less filling.  It’s supremely adaptable. Crispy Cheesy Mashed Potato Pie Serves 4 to 63 lb.  Yukon gold potatoes; if using leftover mashed potatoes, you’ll need about 6 cups2/3 lb.  ripe tomatoes (optional)1 large bunch of scallions,  sliced 3 oz.  sharp cheddar cheese, coarsely grated 3 oz.  aged cheddar, coarsely gratedSalt and freshly ground pepper4 tbsp.  unsalted butter, or to tasteExtra virgin olive oil, for brushingHot sauce, for serving (optional)Peel the potatoes and chop into even-sized chunks.  Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, if using tomatoes, halve them, squeeze out the seeds, and dice the flesh.  Toss with a good pinch of sea salt and transfer to a sieve to drain.  Press out any excess liquid from the tomatoes and mix with the scallions and cheese.  Check for seasoning. Preheat the oven to 400F.  Drain the potatoes, then mash really well with the butter and season to perfection.  Once cool enough to handle, use oiled hands to flatten a little more than half the mashed potatoes in the bottom and a bit up the sides of a 12- by 8-inch nonstick baking pan.  Spread the tomato-cheese mixture over the bottom, almost to the edges.  Press the remaining mashed potatoes on top, smoothing it out and covering the filling.  Make a pattern, if you like on the edge.  Brush the top of the pie with olive oil and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  Let cool slightly, then slice.  Serve with hot sauce, if desired.  For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg. comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2020 Bloomberg L.

She was born on August 28, 2020 at the Oklahoma City Zoo and her mother was not able to raise her.  We have two other young chimpanzees, Lola 1 year 3 months old, and Violet, 10 months old, as well as a chimp who has served as a surrogate mother in the past, so the Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan (SSP) asked if we would hand-raise her until she could be placed with the surrogate mother chimp.  See the attached press releases for information about how Maisie came to us to be raised and how she got her name!

But this year, the 75-foot Norway Spruce came with quite a surprise — hiding inside the branches was an adorable little owl.  The bird was found dehydrated and malnourished after not eating or drinking anything for three days while on a 200-mile journey from Oneonta, New York, where the tree was cut down, to Midtown Manhattan.  Named Rockette, or “Rocky” for short, the owl is recovering nicely at a wildlife center. #https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/owl-nursed-back-to-health-after-being-rescued-from-rockefeller-christmas-tree/vi-BB1bbgsm#UqfyXEik8

Footage of 11-month-old Daisy and her pony, Minnie, was captured by mum Nicky Golsteyn, who shared the footage on the Rowton Stables Facebook page on November 17. Speaking to Storyful, Golsteyn was keen to point out that the young equine enthusiast wasn’t in danger at any point. “A few people have asked if it was dangerous as it looks like the pony is tied to the Land Rover.  But her lead rope was actually only looped through the little step of the Land Rover, so if she did decide to wander off she wouldn’t have taken Daisy and the Land Rover with her,” Golsteyn said. She added, “Minnie just loves following Daisy anywhere. ” Credit: Nicky Golsteyn via Storyful#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/toddler-leads-pony-around-farmyard-101448797.html#rYz9W76Hk

On their website, there is a note explaining that the standard 12-week period required to verify records has been extended by at least a fortnight.  For the simple reason that they have been inundated with claims.  Lockdown, it seems, turned us into a nation of record breakers.  And according to Rory Coleman, who, by adding another 17, took the opportunity to extend his world record of marathons this year to 1,068, there is one person to thank for the upsurge.  “Captain Tom,” he says of the centenarian fundraiser.  “He showed us the way.  Loads of people thought, wow if he’s doing it why aren’t I? We’re all driven to achieve.  And because covid has meant there have been no organised races, where else do you get the satisfaction of achievement? By rewriting the record books. ” That was certainly the aim of Alan Colville.  A keen road racer, he had anticipated spending his summer competing in cycling events.  Instead, like the rest of us, he was confined to home.  “Lockdown brought a context where racing bikes wasn’t an option.  In those times you look for different stuff to test yourself,” he explains.  “Suddenly I had more time, I wasn’t travelling for work, I didn’t feel as stressed.  So it freed my mind to take on a challenge. ” And the one he took on was sizeable.  An accomplished hill climber, who, as lockdown was imposed, had already completed what is known as The Everest (cycling up the equivalent height of the world’s highest mountain), he started to think about how high he could climb.  “In May I did a double Everest on my indoor bike,” he says.  “And I discovered I was built for it.  I only weigh 57kg, and more to the point, I really enjoyed it.  Then I got my head around the idea that it might be possible to break the world record for climbing in 48 hours. ” Around the same time, Carla Molinaro, a veteran of many an ultra-marathon, wondered what she might do after her sport was curtailed.  “As lockdown happened, I saw the races I’d normally train for disappearing.  I thought it was right to use the time to plan an adventure instead.  Breaking the LEJOG [Land’s End to John O’Groats] record popped into my head.  And it stuck there. ” There is a significant gap, however, between thinking you might go for a record and actually doing it.  As Colville discovered.  “Part of the challenge is the organisation.  Guinness issues a set of guidelines specific to the event you are going for.  They set out the evidence you need to acquire to verify that you have achieved what you claim to have done. ” Then there is the planning for the event: the back-up, the nutrition, the kit.  “I talked to a lot of people who’d done LEJOG who told me there was no way I could do this year,” says Molinaro.  “It takes so much organisation, they reckoned the earliest I could do it was the summer of 2021.  I thought: nah I’m really fit, I’m going for this.  It took three months to plan.  But then I didn’t have anything else to do. ” The first thing Colville required was a suitable place to attempt his record.  After weeks of research, he found a hill in Wales, near Abergavenny.  “It was straight, it had a great surface, it was quiet as well, not much traffic,” he says.  “And it had a good mobile signal.  It ticked all those boxes. ” So in early September, together with his support team, after checking the weather, he set off.  “The idea was to cycle for 46 of the 48 hours.  Every minute you stopped, I calculated, you were down 12 metres.  We had all sorts of plans, for nutrition, rest, pacing.  I used to eat while sitting on the toilet to save time. ” Around the same time, Molinaro had begun in Land’s End.  To break the record for the 874 miles to the north of Scotland, she would need to cover at least 72 miles a day for 12 straight days.  It was an astonishingly demanding schedule. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meet-lockdown-super-athletes-ripping-131514431.html#29TRsyVLm

Delica pumpkins are in their prime, so if you can source one for this recipe, please do.  When they come into season, I always buy a few and make sure I use them to their full advantage! If not, you can also use crown prince squash or another pumpkin.  One of the biggest factors here that will help you to achieve a galette packed full of flavour is to taste the filling as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly.  I love chilli, garlic and herbs, so often I will add a bit more of each one to this, but if you are not so keen on an element you can just take it out to suit your palate.  We are making a quick rough-puff-style pastry today, one that doesn’t need to spend hours resting in between folds.  As soon as the pastry is made, it is turned and folded twice, still giving you an absurdly flaky, buttery pastry.  Eat this warm or cold – it is delicious either way.

2020-11-20 20:50:32#sport#How Dolly Parton Saved Christmas (on the Square)-and the Entire Human Race#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dolly-parton-saved-christmas-square-205032073.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WcLrEDAu5RK4Mm8RMNdnKg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/39a988ac7da973e1d7c250519146c4d7#en#1.0#www.yahoo.com#This is a preview of our pop culture newsletter The Daily Beast’s Obsessed, written by senior entertainment reporter Kevin Fallon.  To receive the full newsletter in your inbox each week, sign up for it here. * * *We Literally Wouldn’t Survive Without Dolly Parton* * *I had been all excited to watch Dolly Parton’s Christmas musical on Netflix and write some hyperbolic and, let’s face it, obvious headline about how “Dolly Parton Saved Christmas!” only to realize that 1) I had apparently already written that headline before, and 2) I was selling the Backwoods Barbie far short.  It turns out our Smoky Mountain queen isn’t just saving Christmas, she’s saving the whole danged human race. Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square hits Netflix Sunday, less than a week after it was revealed the music legend helped to fund the research that went toward the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19.  I don’t know how it wasn’t on our 2020 Bingo card that it would be Ms.  Parton who swoops in to rescue us from a pandemic.  Of course it would be her.  The record speaks for itself:And if that weren’t enough, now she’s gifting us a Christmas movie, too.  Having seen it, I can say it’s about 94. 5 percent effective in delivering a pleasant time. Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square may rank among the most earnest things I have ever seen.  It announces itself as such immediately, with Dolly Parton crooning on a studio set as a glowing, sparkling angel posing as a hobo—what if God was one of us, truly—before townspeople start pirouetting down the sidewalk and rhyming “Christmas on the square” with “thermal underwear” in the big opening number. It’s either get on board or get run over by the train with the unapologetic sincerity and schmaltz.  Could something as cheesy as this thrive at any other time? Regardless, it’s a welcome treat to shed the snakeskin of cynicism and despair and just give in to the wholesome world of Dolly Parton at Christmas. In yet another saintly act, Parton has given us a musical in which regal queen Christine Baranski is the lead.  She plays Regina Fuller, a Scrooge in heels who returns to her hometown just before Christmas to tell everyone that she’s selling the land in order to build a giant mall, and they all gotta go.  Only now do I realize that I hadn’t truly lived before seeing Christine Baranski speak-sing an eviction notice in time to a dramatic musical interlude. This Christmas Square has everything: Gays voguing in a hair salon, a pastor and his wife toasting eggnog to fertility treatments, tap dancing in the bank line, a homeless Dolly Parton. The cast is a Who’s Who of Gay Twitter faves.  There’s Baranski, of course, but also Mother of Black Hollywood Jenifer Lewis, The Other Two’s Hot Idiot (Josh Segarra), the best So You Think You Can Dance contestant ever (Jeanine Mason), and sexy dad icon Treat Williams.  It is directed by none other than Miss Debbie Allen. There are A Christmas Carol and It’s a Wonderful Life vibes all over the place.  Regina used to live in the town and her father was everyone’s favorite.  After he died, her heart iced over—hence the holiday evictions—and it’s Angel Dolly’s mission to thaw it. In these scenes, Parton floats over Regina on a billowy cloud, which only raises the issue of how we figure out a way to provide exclusive cumulonimbus transport for Dolly Parton going forward.  It’s what she deserves. There’s a heartrending plot in which Regina meets a young girl wise beyond her years, whose story about losing her mother forces Regina to consider the impact of her actions—especially when tragedy later befalls her, too.  And just when you think you have things figured out, there’s a shockingly intense secret pregnancy and adoption storyline.  Dolly Parton always keeping us on our toes!There are some beautiful Christian ballads—Parton, of course, gets the best ones—and some real corny clunkers.  Sometimes it’s hard to shake the feeling that you’re watching the best community theater production to ever hit Netflix.  It’s an aesthetic that’s best to embrace, as approaching this movie with even an ounce of jadedness would render it unwatchable. There is a lot of talk about the power of prayer and faith.  There are SEVERAL dance production numbers that are set inside of a church.  It’s perhaps the one film that fits in the Venn diagram sweet spot of the Christian agenda and the gay agenda.  Once again, the power of Dolly. No one would argue that what’s going on here is brilliant, or even the best of the myriad new Christmas movies piling up on networks and streaming service like an insurmountable snowdrift. But there’s something refreshing about how heartfelt it is.  If you thought there was going to be a Christmas musical about a Dolly Parton angel changing Christine Baranski’s life that also has a dad singing prayers that his little girl doesn’t die after a car accident and that wouldn’t shatter my brittle-ass gingerbread cookie of a heart until I’m yelping back tears, well… I just don’t know what to tell you.

He became a fisherman in the Tuscan village of Talamone at 13 and still plies the waters at the age of 60 in his small boat, the Sirena.  But in the past decade, his job has become harder, as trawling near the coast has been destroying the marine ecosystem. The impact is devastating.  “The nets are weighed down with heavy chains to be dragged on the sea bottom, so they uproot all the posidonia, the seagrass that is key to the Mediterranean ecosystem because sea bream, lobsters and red gurnards lay their eggs there,” he says. “They don’t care.  Nobody is watching,” he adds.  “It’s like if a hunter burned a whole forest to catch a hare. ”While Italian law bans trawling within three nautical miles of the coast, it’s so profitable that it’s not uncommon for boats to carry on illegally at night.  Some employ lookouts to warn against the coast guard, or use devices to shield their GPS signal. Fanciulli noticed the effects of trawling as early as the 1980s: the damaged ecosystem was affecting his catch and having an impact on his livelihood.  So, along with some other local fishermen and activists from Greenpeace, he blocked a commercial port in Tuscany in protest. It was the beginning of a struggle that has made him something of a local celebrity.  Fanciulli has destroyed trawling nets with barbed wire.  He once stopped a trawler by pretending to be the police.  His activism has seen him interviewed on German and Chinese TV, and people in Talamone regularly stop “Paolo il Pescatore” – Paolo the Fisherman – to inquire about his newborn son. It also earned him enemies, he says: threats from local mafia soon made it impossible for him to sell his fish at the market. He turned instead to what he describes as “pascaturismo”, or fishing tourism: he takes visitors out on his boat, giving them a chance to catch fish and learn about the ecological threat of trawling.  He also runs a small restaurant at weekends, and sells his catch to the Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, a collective of Italian families buying ethical products. It wasn’t enough to stop illegal fishing, however.  In 2006, a desperate Tuscan government dropped concrete blocks into the sea in an effort to disrupt the trawlers.  Fanciulli says they didn’t work, however, as they were too far apart and the nets simply dragged between them. He got permission from Arpa, the agency for environmental protection, to drop an additional 80 blocks at his own expense.  Still, however, he wasn’t satisfied, and his thoughts turned to the shipwrecks he’d loved as a boy.  “I didn’t just want concrete,” he says.  “I was fascinated with beautiful antiquities underwater. ”He began to wonder: what if, instead of dropping concrete blocks into the water, he dropped art?He asked a quarry in nearby Carrara if they could donate two marble blocks that he could use to make sculptures.  “They donated 100 instead. ”Via word of mouth, contributions from tourists and online crowdfunding, Fanciulli persuaded artists including Giorgio Butini, Massimo Lippi, Beverly Pepper and Emily Young to carve sculptures from the marble.  Then he took them out to sea and lowered them in. The underwater sculptures create both a physical barrier for nets and a unique underwater museum.  The sculptures are placed in a circle, 4m apart, with an obelix at the centre carved by the Italian artist Massimo Catalani.  Emily Young provided four sculptures, each weighing 12 tons, she calls “guardians”; nearby lies a mermaid by the young artist Aurora Vantaggiato.  Lippi has contributed 17 sculptures representing Siena’s contrade, or medieval districts. The “museum” is open to anyone who can arrange a visit – either through guided scuba tours or by arranging their own dive. It’s located along the Argentario section of the Tuscan coast, which has been plagued by trawling, and this year boats have been caught carrying illegal nets and fishing in protected waters. Biologist Roberto Danovaro, who heads the Anton Dohrn research institute in Naples, likened trawling to “fishing with bombs”.  “You catch the fish, but also destroy their habitat,” he says.  “With no possibility of growing back because trawling is so intense. ”But the museum appears to be having some effect.  Whereas 10 years ago the Posidonia was disappearing, Dr Gioia Benedettini, sea manager of Arpat, the local environmental agency, says it is now growing back. The statues also deserve credit for helping to preserve the fishing industry, she says: they “protect the fish resources because the nursery areas of various commercial fish species are located below the coast”. Marine life of all kinds appears to be returning.  Algae covers the statues, and lobsters have taken up residence nearby.  Talamone is a turtle recovery centre – part of the Tartalife project – and more turtles have been seen, as have dolphins.  “In the past it was unusual to see dolphins near the coast,” Faniculli says.  “They normally stay offshore, but as industrial fishing destroyed the seabed, they moved close to the statues because, due the repopulation, there is food. ”The museum is Fanciulli’s version of the shipwrecks he loved as a boy, and he hopes to build on its success.  “We put in the first statues in 2007 but our goal is to reach 100,” he says, sensing an opportunity.  “We’d like someone to help our battle in defence of the sea.  Do you know if any soccer player or influencer is available?”#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/underwater-museum-paolo-fisherman-made-080029029.html#nmJGF1kA2

Memphis Inner City Rugby, founded in the southern city in 2012, earned a Sport for Reduced Racial Inequalities Collective Impact Award, guaranteeing “significant investment” and off-field resource support, said Beyond Sport, a nonprofit which works for social change worldwide.  The award was backed by Dick’s Sporting Goods Foundation. Shane Young, who co-founded MICR while working as a teacher but who now runs the show full-time, told the Guardian the award was “really special to all of our students and coaches, especially alumni coaches who have really done something special here in Tennessee, all the way back to our first teams ever”. MICR coaches and players, Young said, had “taken on and embraced a sport they had never heard of.  And, you know, the demographic playing playing rugby here in the south, and Tennessee was, at that time, very homogenous. > We had to cancel a rugby season like everybody else … over the summer and spring we delivered thousands of bags of food> > Shane Young“It took a lot of bravery, courage, trust and spirit for our kids to break down those barriers and do the amazing things they’ve done, the trails they’ve blazed and they’ve broken.  This is for them.  They really deserve this recognition. ”MICR aims to get young Tennesseans scrummaging, passing, kicking and tackling but it also focuses on off-field education and development, aiming to send hookers, props and flankers who might otherwise miss out on college to play rugby while studying for four-year degrees. That pipeline, Young said, “is working well.  College rugby scholarships are a very sort of wild, wild west landscape right now.  And it’s hard to traverse.  But we’re in a good position to help our kids through that confusing opportunity. “From our class of 2019, one [Carlicia Beam] is now a student at Dartmouth and one [KaDerrius Campbell] is at Bowdoin.  We’ve had students at Tufts, playing a national championship in division three.  And then the University of Memphis, it’s becoming normal for the Tigers roster to have Memphis Inner City Rugby alumni, staying locally and playing and doing a great job. ”On the national scene, the most prominent MICR graduate is Calvin Gentry, an athlete promising enough to play representative rugby and even attract the attentions of a film crew – a project Young says is ongoing.  When the Guardian spoke to Young in December 2017, the powerful back-row forward was playing for Arkansas State. “The last spring when the world was normal,” Young says, referring to a time pre-Covid, Gentry “transferred back to University of Memphis, after his sophomore year, and then he led the Memphis Tigers to top 16 in the country in division two.  So on the field he’s done a great job [as he has] off the field.  He’s one of our best coaches here at MICR.  An incredible leader of young men. ”In answer to speculation in comment sections and Reddit threads, Young confirms that Gentry is “ready to go play in MLR”, meaning Major League Rugby, the US professional competition, though he “can’t say which team yet, as Calvin hasn’t announced it”.  If MLR’s fourth season survives Covid, it will kick-off in March. MICR, Young says, has been maintaining as much active rugby as possible across its network of schools.  Fittingly, though, the Beyond Sport award arrives at a time when much of MICR’s work is being done beyond the sports field. “We had to cancel a rugby season like everybody else,” Young says, “but we have all these great coaches and we have a small staff and we want to keep serving.  And so we just adapted and over the summer and spring we delivered thousands of bags of food and toilet paper and razor blades, batteries, you know, flashlights, different things to help keep our families at home, out of the grocery stores, out of the convenience stores and saving money. “And we’re able to pay our own alumni coaches, so essentially our own students, to do this work and to execute this plan.  And so they earned money while they were laid off of their jobs.  And they were able to help a lot of people in the process. ”The summer also saw nationwide protests against racial injustice, over the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis.  The moment, and the movement, touched MICR. “Memphis is more than 60% an African American city,” Young says.  “And so the protests inspired MICR to launch our first ever diversity, equity and inclusion committee, which is entirely led and operated by a cohort of our alumni, with the chairwoman Teyonce Harris and under the guidance of one of our board members, Isabel Rodriguez, who works for a great organisation called Facing History and Ourselves. ”The committee, he said, aims to pursue “different initiatives in terms of representing the students we serve properly in the makeup of our board of directors, the makeup of our staff”.  It also looks to “make sure our allocations and investment and our programming is designed not to discriminate or do the easy work, with maybe the students who are most available, but to make sure that our resources and our potential to make an impact is equitable in the communities, to make sure that our young women and young men are pushing our way and pulling us to do better. ”One person playing a key part in that push, he said, is programme coordinator Jordan Young. “Jordan is one of our first ever players to graduate college.  So he was one of the first freshmen back in 2012, graduated, played four years with us and then went to college, graduated in four years from the University of Memphis, and we just hired him and now he is coaching our coaches. ”#https://sports.yahoo.com/bravery-courage-trust-spirit-memphis-140007726.html#IswUuIU2l

Capable of very human behaviours and even similar facial expressions, it is not difficult to believe that we are so closely related.  This gorilla baby is enjoying some affectionate time with his mother, having just had his morning milk.  But what he does after he is finished is a behaviour that we have all seen young human children do very frequently.  He sticks a finger up his nose, looks at what he has pulled out and promptly pops his finger into his mouth.  He repeats this several times in a way that looks as if he has been exposed to human children and he has learned this from them.  The truth is that this baby has almost definitely not see this action performed by people and that he has simply learned it on his own for whatever reason.  This might suggest that some of the same instinctive behaviour is influencing the gorillas and ourselves in a similar way.  These are western lowland gorillas, the smaller of the subspecies, yet the males can reach a weight of 270kg (600lbs).  They have incredible strength and are reported to be 7-8 times as powerful as an Olympic weightlifter, although this is not easily verified.  standing erect, can reach a height of almost 2m (6ft).  They possess formidable teeth and jaw strength, capable of a biting force that is greater than a large dog.  Despite such immense power, gorillas are generally calm and non-aggressive unless disturbed or threatened.  Even the adult males, known as silverbacks, are not likely to attack humans unless provoked.  The western lowland gorilla is a critically endangered species.  These gorillas live at the Toronto Zoo, one of the world's highest rated zoos, and recipient of numerous top awards related to conditions and health programs for the animals.  They are world leaders in conservation efforts and education.  When considering which facilities to support or avoid, a little research goes a long way.  Supporting the organizations that are active in animal welfare around the world is crucial if we want to see animals like these survive. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/baby-gorilla-engages-surprisingly-human-152505557.html#3tSVQdJBO

Footage captured by Ian Beckley shows the clouds moving over Albuquerque from his perch on Sandia Crest mountain. Beckley told Storyful he decided to record a cloud video after he saw a cold front in the forecast that he thought would bring the right kind of cloudy conditions.  After six days of waking up at 2 am to drive to the top of Sandia Crest, which is approximately 10,000 feet tall, Beckley said the clouds dropped low enough for him to shoot the stunning sunrise video. “The city is at 6,000 feet and has mainly sunny days.  Getting any type of cloud inversion is very rare,” Beckley said. The National Weather Service predicted that a cold front would affect the region on the same date.

Wilson had been separated from her pet for two months as she cared for her father, who was undergoing cancer treatment, and harbored fears of Millie being upset by her absence.  “It was very hard to be away from her, and I was a little concerned she would be upset with me for leaving for so long,” she told Storyful.  Thankfully, those fears were unfounded and Millie gave her owner an enthusiastic welcome when she walked through her front door, as can be seen from a video on her Facebook account .  “After a very sad two months, it was a lovely welcome home,” she added.

A study into wild chimpanzees, based on 78,000 hours of observation, found that the apes focused on fewer, but more meaningful friendships in their later years.  Researchers claim it is the first evidence that a species other than humans alter how they socialise depending on their age.  Scientists from the Harvard department of human evolutionary biology looked at the social interactions of 21 chimps between the ages of 15 and 58 in a study spanning 1995 to 2016.  Their work was based at Kibale National Park in Uganda and focused specifically on male chimps, which build stronger social bonds and are more socially active than females.  It was found that older chimps preferred spending more time with - and grooming - chimps they had developed mutual friendships with over the years.  Younger chimps, however, had more one-sided relationships where grooming wasn't always returned.  Older males were also more likely to spend more time alone but interacted with more important social partners like their ageing mutual friends, the study, published in the journal Science, found.  Much like humans in their later years, the older chimps sought out peace and quiet more regularly and tended to make their social interactions more positive than negative.  Alexandra Rosati, an assistant professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan and one of the paper's lead authors, said: ""The really cool thing is that we found that chimpanzees are showing these patterns that mirror those of humans. "" She added: ""There's really a pressing need to understand the biology of ageing.  ""More humans are living longer than in the past, which can change the dynamics of ageing. "" Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology and founder and co-director of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project, said: ""Even though chimps are very smart, they do not understand they're going to die.  ""Much more likely something else is going on in chimps to explain why their relationships become more positive as they get older.  And then the question is what applies to chimps the same as what applies to humans. """#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/chimps-humans-share-same-interest-192653859.html#Hc66H8cFa

From its earliest mass swelling in the fertile heart of Polynesia, the culture of surfing grew as a playful device for altering, informing, and reinforcing cultural values.  Early surfing cultures adopted wave riding for its ability to create camaraderie and provide physical challenge, cultural cohesion, and experiential spirituality.  The origins of surfing in Polynesia made it clear that this was a cultural practice of deep and meaningful play for everyone: mothers, grandfathers, warriors, princesses, children.  Play and travel were, and still are, entwined with the definitions of what it means to be a surfer.  As our ancient ancestors did, we modern wave riders devote our lives to the pursuit of the vibrant edge that surfing offers – a deeply nourishing, and highly addictive, perpetual passion for one-more-wave that begs us on to both the most crowded and most remote swathes of sand by the planet’s oceans.  The sport and art of surfing was of such value to early Hawaiians that it was forbidden to work or wage war during prime surf season – everyone took a full three months off over winter for the Makahiki Festival, a period of spiritual cleansing and sport.  The ancients knew what we have forgotten: play is part of what makes us human.  Working too hard or too often doesn’t necessarily lead to increased productivity or happiness, or to a sense of community.  Neoteny – the retention of playful, childlike characteristics – is an essential part of human evolution because it opens up doors to creativity, spontaneity and visions of new ways of being in the world.  Most human cultures have tended to have more leisure time than work time.  In Hawaii, a culture rich in aquatic lore and myth abounded before the threats of colonisation.  Surfing was part of a sensuous way of life that also included hula dancing, chanting, and outlets for play entwined with spirituality.  But when European notions of religiosity, gender and the Protestant work ethic came to govern Polynesia and beyond, the wild freedom of wave riding was nearly lost, and later assumed as an endeavour only for men.  Historians of Ancient Polynesia acknowledge that it was women, in fact, who seemed to stand in the highest regard for their skill and poise as surfers.  Woven deep into the chants and lore of surfing culture are the stories of revered women – such as Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, and Princess Kelea – who rode the waves with the utmost grace and athleticism.  Right now, women are reclaiming our natural place in the global sport, art and culture of surfing.  While men’s performances and perspectives have tended to dominate in surfing, the past three decades have seen women’s participation increase exponentially.  Women now make up between 20 and 30 per cent of surfers, and that number continues to grow. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/life-ocean-wave-joy-freedom-091001339.html#j7tHPZfBG

Carol Danvers’ orange sidekick is actually a flerken (an alien with massive tentacles hidden inside her mouth), but Goose’s fluffy coat and knack for getting into trouble puts her firmly in the cat category. Binx, “Hocus Pocus” (1993)Thackery Binx was just a normal teenage boy in 1693 before he was cursed to live forever in the body of a black cat.  But hey, everyone goes through weird phases in their teens. Cat, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” (1961)Let’s make this clear: Holly Golightly does not own this cat.  He belongs to nobody and nobody belongs to him.  But that doesn’t stop him from playing a pivotal role in the movie, including the tear-jerking final scene. Jonesy, “Alien” (1979)This orange tabby was the unofficial mascot of the USCSS Nostromo and one of the few crew members to survive a Xenomorph attack.  He also remains the only character to successfully steal a scene from Sigourney Weaver. Mr.  Jinx, “Meet the Parents” (2000)This movie should actually be called “Meet the Parents’ Cat,” because Mr.  Jinx is the real star.  The perpetually-frowning Himalayan cat is Jack Byrnes’ pride and joy, and knows how to come when called, wave and even use the toilet.  That’s called a ‘triple threat’ in showbiz. Tonto, “Harry and Tonto” (1974)Art Carney’s portrayal of a feisty retiree on a cross-country road trip won him an Academy Award, while his feline costar didn’t even get a nomination.  What gives?Church, “Pet Sematary” (1989, 2019)Ellie Creed’s playful kitty Winston Churchill was run over by a truck and came back from the dead as Church to terrorize his former owners.  That’s something to consider before burying your cat in a cursed cemetery. Ulysses, “Inside Llewyn Davis” (2013)This honey-colored tabby joined Oscar Isaac’s grumpy folk musician as he wandered around New York City and Chicago in the Coen brothers’ film.  Though he takes up more screen time than many of the human actors, the feline actor isn’t named in the credits — perhaps because the character was played by three separate (but equally adorable) animal performers. Mr.  Bigglesworth, “Austin Powers” series When Dr.  Evil’s cat, Mr.  Bigglesworth, gets upset, people die.  Honestly, Dr.  Evil doesn’t sound too different from the average cat owner. Fat Louie, “The Princess Diaries” (2001)Behind every great princess of Genovia is an equally great black-and-white kitty.

Grab a nice big handful of walnuts.  Both of these foods are rich in omega-3 fatty acids (aka ""essential fatty acids""), which are long chains of fats that are actually good for you and are known for supporting heart health.  In fact, new findings suggest that eating more of them regularly may even help save your life if you were to ever suffer from a heart attack. A recent study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology took a look at heart attack patients who were admitted to the hospital and found that those who had higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids were less likely to die, or even require re-hospitalization, during the three years following their heart attack compared to other patients.  Specifically, this research looked for two kinds omega-3s—eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)—in the bloodwork of 944 heart attack patients with an average age of 61,  209 of which were women.  (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time. )EPA has already been associated with a lower risk of heart attack, and its best-known food source is fatty fish, including salmon and mackerel.  ALA has also already been associated with a lower risk of death in the event of a heart attack, and its best food sources include walnuts, flaxseeds, and canola oil.  After following the heart attack patients' progress for three years, the researchers found that those with higher levels of EPA and ALA in their blood at the time they were admitted to the hospital for a heart attack were more likely to be alive at the end of the study.  Those with higher levels of EPA were also less likely to require readmission to the hospital during that timeframe.  From this, the scientists concluded that a diet rich in omega-3s could serve as a smart heart attack prevention strategy.

More inquisitive and more intelligent than we give them credit for, they are much like giant puppies in their personalities.  These calves live on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario.  They wander freely in the meadow for most of the year, exploring the woods and rolling hills, and they drink fresh water from the ponds on the farm.  They are part of a large, and very happy herd that enjoy the freedom here, grazing contentedly throughout the day.  They are joined by Gus, a huge, but relaxed bull that watches over his herd protectively.  These calves have gathered around to check out a new visitor in their meadow.  They are very curious about the small camera that he has and they watch him carefully, although they are reluctant to approach him close enough to sniff at the strange object that he is holding.  He puts the camera down in the grass and moves back a few steps.  Predictably, the calves gather around and look even more closely.  They can't resist the urge to get a good look and even lick at the camera.  The result is some very adorable footage of their noses and eyes peering right into the lens.  But when one of them nudges the camera and it tips over in the grass, they all jump in unison and get ready to run.  When nothing dangerous happens, they slowly return to their investigation of the amusing object. #https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/other/calves-adorably-startled-when-they-tip-over-the-camera/vi-BB1afATq?li=BBnbklE#n0JlQQkST

Although it was initially intended for his family's enjoyment, over the years it’s grown into a neighborhood “must-see,” and an attraction that their community looks forward to visiting each year on Halloween.  When Pace’s wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, this endeavor became a passion project and he started to out-do himself with each passing Halloween season.  Decorations and massive displays brought joy to his wife and the whole neighborhood, but also became an avenue to raise money for local charities. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/family-builds-hogwarts-castle-front-163300020.html#0SM5w0umV

Members of the public had seen the fox trapped in Saint Saviour’s Dock, Southwark, on a muddy bank.  The fox had been cornered by the river and the incoming tide, RSPCA inspector Rebecca Phillips said in a press release by the animal welfare group. As the water rose, the animal sought safety on the hull of the small rowboat. “He climbed onto the hull of the boat to escape the water.  Firefighters managed to hook the rope for the boat, and carefully pulled it over to a scaffolding platform, crossing the river underneath a bridge so we could try to catch him,” Phillips said. According to the same press release, as rescuers prepared their equipment and assessed the best way to catch the fox, the frightened critter slipped off the boat and into the water. Phillips said that she looked “frantically” for a minute and heard scratching underneath her feet, before spotting the fox, who had jumped onto a scaffolding pole below. “I managed to loop my grasper around his body to secure him and get a hand onto his rear end to pull him up onto the platform,” she said.  “We’d attracted quite a crowd, so it’s great that they were able to see him being saved and that we got a lovely, happy ending. ”The fox was fed and dried off, before he was brought to a safe place and released back into the wild.

Sold signs, hitherto a rarity, have begun appearing, like vivid Post-its, on the brick-and-stucco façades of next-door houses.  Worn out by months of lockdown, many of her neighbours are quitting town and heading to the country to discover a greener, quieter way of life.  Trelawny, 48, a caterer to leading fashion designers and magazines, isn’t joining the exodus.  The mother of two grew up in the Cotswolds, surrounded by ‘fields and valleys, dogs and endless ponies: Cider with Rosie stuff ’.  Drawing on those memories, she’s cultivated her own urban idyll here.  Gilt-framed oils chorus from leaf-green walls, while brown furniture and chintzy upholstery give this town house the charm of an old fashioned rectory. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/bring-countryside-city-home-104416142.html#5OXan4QJi

Her instruction was to meow like a cat — out loud — during the assignment.  students received bonus points if they meowed on their test — but apparently, more than 90 percent of them failed to do so.  As several kids meowed, some students seemed baffled by the situation.  “Why was everyone saying ‘meow?'”.  As one of her students explained, it was “a test to see who was listening”.  The method earned praise from parents and teachers on TikTok, with several users commenting that it was a “great idea”.  “My high schoolers would start meowing just because others were,” one user wrote.  Others were more critical, saying many students might feel too nervous to make a strange noise out loud during a test.  “Sounds good except my son has anxiety that won’t allow him to do that,” one user wrote#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/teacher-tiktok-shares-genius-trick-210823121.html#CnoS9Rh8O

And then he had to move to Texas for his work.  He thought he’d never see Blue again. ” The shelter said Pat’s friend spotted a video showing his beloved pet playing ball at their facility, prompting Pat to contact them immediately to make arrangements.  Footage posted to Facebook shows the moment Pat was reunited with Blue after making the trip from Texas to Johnson City, Tennessee, where the shelter is located.  “We don’t many happy endings like this one,” the shelter wrote.  “There were some tears, tons of doggie kisses and lots of smiles.

The island has lush green forested areas in the highlands, dry areas on the coast that resemble an arid desert, a thriving town, and wildlife that is diverse and fascinating.  One of the most iconic animals in the world, the giant Galapagos Tortoise makes its home here.  Loved and well protected by the residents, these tortoises have seen a dramatic increase in numbers since their conservation efforts have been implemented.  The tortoises draw thousands of tourists each year, which is important to people living in this remote world.  The tortoises also represent a very important part of the overall health of the fragile ecosystem.  Galapagos tortoises wander freely on Santa Cruz.  There are rehab and captive breeding centers, as well as more protected areas, but the tortoises are free to roam wherever they please, often making long treks to find nesting areas or breeding opportunities.  Living as long as 200 years, and possibly longer, these tortoises will lay many eggs in their lifetime.  They will also grow to a staggering 225kg (500lbs) with a shell large enough to fill the passenger compartment of a small car.  It is always a treat for the residents, or the tourists, to find a tortoise on the move.  This giant male had taken a casual stroll down a bike path, making his way from the highlands in the direction of the ocean far below.  Solon and his daughter were driving past in their electric car when they spotted the giant beast enjoying a rest and a meal at the side of the pedestrian/bike path.  They stopped so that Solon could capture the moment and also so that he could deliver a short nature lesson for Abigail and others who would see his video later.  Abigail seems interested enough, but these are animals that she will see frequently as she grows up on this incredible island.  She will see sea lions, pelicans, crabs, iguanas and stingrays here regularly as well.  These animals that the rest of us will likely only see on nature shows make their home all around her.  The people of the Galapagos Islands have a love and respect for the wildlife that is second to none.  They maintain their distance and respectfully avoid interfering with any of the animals.  They will gently guide or correct any of the tourists who are tempted to bend or break the rules with respect to distance or feeding of the wildlife, knowing that nature does not need any help from mankind.  The people of the Galapagos Islands are leaders in environmental responsibility.  They have banned single use plastics.  They allow only taxis, small motorcycles and electric cars on the island.  In this way, pollution is kept to a minimum.  They also understand and protect the delicate balance that is important to the native species. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gigantic-galapagos-tortoise-leave-awe-235839320.html#JT5izQd86

For Americans facing the COVID-19 lockdown and economic instability through the spring and summer, that became a difficult question to ask--and to answer.  Things were already pretty bad.  And then the presidential election began in earnest.

According to a new report based on three surveys by the nonpartisan organization More in Common, 'About 7 in 10 Americans are worried about the risk of widespread violence breaking out across the country after election results are announced. ' In this article, Greater Good offers eight inquiries that can help us navigate this period. #http://www.dailygood.org/view.php?qid=8630#3OUjPbuc4

Here we see one bathing in a backyard pond.  Although it looks very angry, it's clear it is having a very good time! As it splashes and dips into the water, the facial features and markings over the eyes make it appear to be holding a serious frown.  These birds are called ""American Robins"" because they are native to North America, and because they have a red breast, similar to the European robin.  But the European robin is flycatcher and is in a completely different family.  The American robin is actually a thrush, and a songbird.  They are abundantly found in all types of habitat.  Robins are significant carriers and spreaders of the dangerous West Nile Virus.  Although we typically blame crows and jays for this spread, because we see the die from it early and in larger numbers, the robin is just as capable of contracting the virus and then living longer, promoting a greater spread to humans through the mosquitos which are the intermediary hosts.  Robins have keen eyesight to help them find their prey; grubs, insects and earthworms, but they actually use their hearing to find food as well.  The robin listens carefully for the sound of an earthworm moving just beneath the surface of the ground.  It can detect the worm and pounce, pulling it from its hole.  They use smell and even detect vibration to find their food.  It is believed that birds like the robin bathe in water or in dust to maintain the preferred amount of oil on their feathers and to discourage mites and other parasites.

Ivy previously appeared in a video that went viral in which Dean sang the Burt Bacharach song What the World Needs Now Is Love.  Writing on Instagram, Dawn said that Ivy’s no longer a “lap donkey. ”The Fagans run Jackass Junction, a 67-acre donkey sanctuary where they care for rescued farm animals.  Dawn manages their social media pages and regularly posts footage of the farm’s residents.

For years it was believed that the endangered Fin Whale sang just one song pattern, which is unique to the males in his particular group.  But using underwater microphones researchers have discovered they can produce different melodies that spread to other parts of the ocean as groups travel.  A total of 116 whale encounters were analysed near Kauai, which is part of the Hawaiian archipelago, over the course of six years.  Recordings discovered that while male fin whales living in the Pacific Ocean only sing two notes at a very low pitch, these are produced in different rhythms to create songs.  Five main patterns of songs were recorded in the area, some of which were geographically unique, but others were similar to those recorded in whale groups off the north-west coast of the US. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/whales-swap-songs-other-groups-163957818.html#LCqYrNIIn
