Confidence is a desirable trait—it can make you seem happier, smarter, and even more attractive.  Luckily, you don't necessarily need to have confidence to make other people think that you do.  In fact, you can literally fake it until you make it, just by plastering a smile on your face.  Experts say that simply making smiling a habit can immediately make you seem more confident to other people.  Read on to find out why, and for behaviors to avoid, ditch This Habit That Makes You Seem Less Confident to Others. ""When people see you smiling, they assume everything's going well and perceive your facial expression as a moniker for success,"" says Bryan Bruno, MD, medical director at Mid City TMS in New York.  ""A smile will make people trust your decisions and feel supported by you because it is a universal sign that you are worry-free. ""People may also view your smile as a positive indicator of confidence because it makes them ""feel more at ease and welcoming,"" says William L.  Balanoff, DDS, science consultant for Abova Health and founder of Oral Care Perfected.  This is because smiling is literally contagious. A 2016 study published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences found that smiling makes everyone around you feel better, as they are usually either consciously or unconsciously smiling with you.  According to the researchers, this is because people have an instinct for facial mimicry, which is where someone imitates the facial expressions of others. Balanoff says a smile can do more than just make you appear more confident and make people want to be around you.  It can also help you feel more confident. ""Nothing gives you more instant and immediate confidence than displaying a smile,"" Balanoff explains.  ""Our body and mind respond with a cascade of hormones that will lift your spirit when this happens. ""RELATED: For more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter. It's true, and it's backed by science.  ""Pulling your face muscles together into a smile will trigger your brain to release endorphins,"" Bruno explains. Isha Gupta, MD, a neurologist from IGEA Brain and Spine, explained to NBC in 2017 that through his research, he found that the simple act of smiling can produce a chemical reaction in the brain, releasing certain ""happy hormones,"" such as dopamine and serotonin. ""These 'happy hormones' can ease your perception of pain, reduce stress and anxiety, and yes, boost your confidence by making you feel good about yourself,"" Bruno says.  ""Taking a moment to smile throughout your day will chemically enhance your perception of events and make you feel more confident over time. "" And for more ways to seem self-assured, stop saying these Words That Make You Sound Less Confident, According to Experts. "#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/YeesfNkRq#YeesfNkRq#162#12#6751#0#0

Dudzinski posted a video to his Facebook page showing the deer walking right up to Nolff just as she is setting up for her last shot of the day. “This has never happened before to either of us,” Dudzinski told Storyful.  “I was a little surprised as I was watching her out there and happened to glance over and see the deer approaching the green.  I was a little nervous as you never know how deer might react, but Katie is an animal whisperer.  It was an encounter is if she was petting a dog,” he said. Nolff says hello to the buck and lets it smell her hand before she sets up again, and sinks her shot. The deer sticks around while Nolff and Dudzinski retrieve the ball, as Nolff suggests that perhaps the animal wants to play with them, and proceeds to pick up and throw the ball for the deer, who is apparently not into fetch. The couple had celebrated their upcoming nuptials with friends and family earlier in the day, and told Storyful that they thought the deer could be the spirit of Nolff’s late father stopping by to wish them well.

Rémila the kitten was abandoned, Esther Abrami said, and rescued by the shelter Association Féli-Cité in Aix-en-Provence.  Her family acted as the kitten’s host, she said on Instagram.  “When she arrived she was less than 400 grams, scared and had breathing issues from having stayed outside for several days.  I’m happy to say that after seven days of milk bottles and constant cuddles Rémila has now become one of the friendliest cats I’ve ever seen. ”The only problem was that she refused to be left on the floor, Abrami said.  But, as this video of her playing Fauré’s Aprés un Rêve shows, she found the perfect solution.  Rémila is by turns rapt and napping in her fanny pack as she plays.

A science fiction fan inspired by Elon Musk’s Tesla, he set his sights on designing an electric flying car.  Now his Airspeeder racing series is being touted as the future of motorsport.  The F1 of the skies will see manned, open cockpit ‘multicopters’ competing at speeds of up to 80mph in a Star Wars-style aerial dual.  Pearson hopes it will one day inspire the possibility of domestic flying cars.  An Airspeeder features a set of rotor blades at each corner and has the ability to take off and land vertically, just like a helicopter.  Roughly the size of a bobsleigh, the batteries last about ten minutes and pilots will need to swap machines at regular pit stops during races.  Dangerous? Not a bit, as the company behind the idea, Alauda Aeronautics, has developed collision avoidance technology, similar to systems already starting to appear in semi-autonomous cars we already drive on the road. #https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/QU3olkwU3#QU3olkwU3#92#1#2091#0#0

""I told her we weren't going to sit around and watch YouTube all summer,"" Colleen Radke told KARE 11.  When asked how she came up with the idea to see 67 waterfalls, Wynn said simply, ""Just thought of it in my brain. ""The Radkes live in Minneapolis, and over the course of five months, they traveled across Minnesota and into western Wisconsin to visit waterfalls, starting at Fairy Falls in March and ending at Winnewissa Falls in August.  While some waterfalls were visible from roads, other times Wynn and Colleen had to hike several miles in order to see the cascading water. Colleen recently went back to work after being furloughed, and she's grateful for the five months she spent chasing waterfalls with Wynn, especially since it came as she was finalizing a stressful divorce.  ""It was just a really fun time for the two of us to bond and grow and heal together,"" she said.

Prep time: 35 minutes | Cooking time: 45 minutes SERVES eight INGREDIENTS For the cake 225g plain flour 1½ tsp baking powder Pinch of salt 200g unsalted butter 200g light brown sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 60g tahini 3 eggs 50ml milk For the topping 160g mascarpone 80g icing sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 50ml double cream For decorating 4–6 figs, quartered Handful of blackberries 1 tsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted METHOD Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4.  Grease a round 23cm cake pan and line with baking parchment.  To make the cake, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a small bowl and set aside.  Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla for five minutes, or until pale and creamy.  Add the tahini and beat for one minute, or until combined.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl every so often.  With the mixer on low speed, pour in half of the flour, followed by the milk.  Pour in the remainder of the flour and beat gently until combined.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the cake is a deep golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Leave the cake to cool before removing from the pan.  To make the topping, add the mascarpone and icing sugar to a small bowl and mix by hand with a spatula or spoon until smooth.  Stir in the vanilla extract and double cream to loosen it up before using an offset spatula to spread the mascarpone evenly on top of the cake.  To decorate, arrange the figs and blackberries in a crescent shape along one side of the cake.  Finish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

It's true! By using some ordering hacks, doing some assembling yourself, and being extra kind to the person behind the counter, you can create the McDonald's secret menu items of your dreams. Struggling to decide between an apple pie or a McFlurry for dessert? Put them together for an Apple Pie McFlurry.  In the mood for both breakfast and lunch? Then get yourself a McBrunch Burger.  It's time to combine different menu items for maximum McDonald's deliciousness.  Because while Big Macs and McGriddles are great, these McDonald's secret menu items might be even better. And for more, don't miss these 15 Classic American Desserts That Deserve a Comeback. 1 McBrunch BurgerWhat to order: Cheeseburger or double cheeseburger, round or folded egg, and a hashbrownIf you can't decide between a breakfast sandwich and a burger, you can always build your own McBrunch Burger.  Just order a regular or double burger and add an egg and a hashbrown to it.  You might have to assemble it yourself, but it's worth it. RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!2 Orange CreamsicleWhat to order: Soft serve and orange FantaThe secret McDonald's Orange Creamsicle is just a splash of orange Fanta on your vanilla soft serve.  But this is another order you'll have to make at the counter because you can't add Fanta onto your ice cream on the McDonald's app either.  We have to warn you that when you make this odd request, you might end up getting charged for a drink.  But if your McDonald's has a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, you can always create an Orange Creamsicle by adding the Fanta yourself. RELATED: Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!3 Surf&Turf BurgerWhat to order: Cheeseburger and Filet-O-FishWho needs steak and shrimp when you can have a burger patty and a Filet-O-Fish patty on one massive sandwich, thanks to this McDonald's secret menu item?4 Land, Sea,&Air BurgerWhat to order: One cheeseburger, one McChicken, one Filet-O-FishIf you want to take the Surf&Turf Burger to the next level, throw in a McChicken and combine all three patties to make a Frankenstein-style secret McDonald's sandwich.  Because you'll have to assemble this one yourself, you can add in another bun (or two) in the middle, Big Mac-style. 5 Big McChickenWhat to order: Big Mac and three McChickensIs the Land, Sea,&Air Burger still not enough protein for you? Try this McDonald's secret menu item instead: the Big McChicken.  To create this monstrosity, you'll have to order a Big Mac and three (yes, three) McChickens.  When you get your sandwiches, replace the buns with the McChicken patties.  It will get messy, but it will definitely help you hit that daily protein goal.

You can make one at McDonald's by adding a couple of spoonfuls of a McFlurry between two chocolate chip cookies.  It will get messy, but it will also be delicious. 7 Hashbrown McMuffinWhat to order: McMuffin sandwich of your choice and a hashbrownReally, what isn't better with a crunchy McDonald's hashbrown? Just order your favorite McMuffin sandwich and add a hashbrown into it and voila: Hashbrown McMuffin. 8 Apple Pie McFlurryWhat to order: Plain McFlurry and an apple pieThis McDonald's secret menu item requires some effort from employees, so it's probably not the best thing to order if there's a huge line behind you.  That said, all you have to do is order an apple pie blended into a plain McFlurry.  But if the employee doesn't seem game, you can always mash it in yourself. 9 McCrepeWhat to order: Stack of Hotcakes and Fruit 'N Yogurt ParfaitIf you want a budget brunch, the McCrepe is a pretty easy McDonald's menu hack.  Simply order a Fruit 'N Yogurt Parfait and put it on top of a stack of McDonald's Hotcakes.  And there you have it!10 Poor Man's Big MacWhat to order: McDouble with no ketchup, add lettuce and Big Mac SauceIf you love Big Mac sauce but don't want that extra bun in the middle of your burger, you can save a bit of money by tricking out a McDouble instead to create the Poor Man's Big Mac.  You'll have to order this one at the counter because you can't add Big Mac sauce to a McDouble through the McDonald's app.  We promise it's worth it, though!And for more, check out these 108 most popular sodas ranked by how toxic they are. #https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/qwm84flx4#qwm84flx4#180#4#3397#0#0

All violators will be tossed to the floor! Einstein the Talking Texan Parrot is a silly, smart, and popular parrot who loves to talk and entertain! He knows the names of several animals and likes to make their sounds.  In addition to his silly vocalizations, he likes to have conversations with his owners, talking, doing animal sound imitations, and acting silly.  He also enjoys singing and dancing in some of his video compilations.  With his amazing talking abilities and funny antics, Einstein the talking parrot’s videos will keep you entertained for hours! Einstein parrot is also famous for some of his silly quotes and sayings.  Online, Einstein, the talking parrot is popular across many social media platforms.  Einstein’s favorite places to talk at home is perched on the shower wall, in the kitchen on his drawer, and on his screened-in back porch.  As stated on his website, Einstein’s mission statement: “To entertain and bring joy, to foster the human-parrot bond, and to convey that parrots are deserving of immeasurable amounts of patience, nurturing, and companionship. ” Einstein’s website, einsteinparrot. com is designed to inform you about the care of parrots and also entertain you.  As previously mentioned, Einstein is popular on many social media sites such as YouTube @einsteinparrot, Instagram @einsteinparrot, Twitter @einsteinparrot, and Facebook @einsteintexanparrot.  Living with a parrot is a big commitment.  Parrots live a very long time.  A parrot such as Einstein can live to be 50 or 60 years old.  Many larger parrots like Macaws can live to be 100 years old.  They all require a lot of care, proper nutrition, training, time, and patience.  Parrots need a lot of attention and lots of toys and activities to keep from being bored.  Parrots are also expensive, a large cage is an investment, and plenty of play perches to spend out of cage time.  Specialized veterinarian care is also required.  Most of all they require your companionship and a forever home.  Many people decide after the first few years of parrot ownership that the responsibility is too great and the parrots become neglected and sometimes abandoned.  When that happens they are sent to parrot rescue facilities to be adopted by a new family or some spend their lives in sanctuaries.  It is often said, “Having a parrot is much like raising a raising a 2 to a 3-year-old child for the rest of your life!”#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/1mPEWVacm#1mPEWVacm#260#8#3612#0#0

But familiarity isn't all we love about these 25 beloved but all-but-forgotten desserts.  They were great when we were growing up, and they're just as delicious now. Read on as we make our case for giving these retro classics the comeback that we believe are their ""just desserts. "" And for more, don't miss these 15 Classic American Desserts. 1 Cream PiesCan we take just a moment here to wax reverential about the single-crusted, whipped-cream-topped, custard-based wonder that is cream pie? The cream pie came into existence as a way of using up surplus eggs and milk products from the family farm (think: buttermilk pie, chess pie, and sugar cream pies) and blossomed into ubiquity as shelf-stable cocoa, coconut, and bananas became more and more widely available. By the mid-20th century, mile-high cream pies had become one of the defining features of classic diner culture.  If cream pies have lost ground in the intervening decades, it can only be because so many other desserts have cropped up to distract us.  And that just seems wrong.  So, let's bring them back, starting with our surprisingly healthy recipe for Coconut Cream Pie. RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!2 French Fruit TartsSpeaking of cream pies, who else remembers the classic French fruit tart, which was, essentially, a single-crusted custard pie topped with sugar-glazed fresh fruit? Back in the 1980s, this slender, colorful, mildly-flavored sweet was a staple of dessert carts and also managed to pass as a brunch selection at some of the fancier hotels. Maybe it wasn't the healthiest brunch choice, but the French fruit tart certainly was—and remains—an attractive, delicious vehicle for fresh berries.  Let's start putting this back on dessert plates today, starting with our recipe for Fruit and Cream Tarts. RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!3 Southern-Style Banana PuddingIn the South, banana pudding is neither banana nor pudding.  It's vanilla custard layered with banana slices and vanilla wafers.  The wafers become delightfully soggy, like the Ritz crackers in old fashioned ""mock apple pie"" or the chocolate wafers in ""icebox cake. "" It's hard to find this old-fashioned, Southern granny-approved treat outside the American South, but we have a wonderful Banana Pudding Recipe. Don't miss these 50 Best Vintage Recipes from the South. 4 Apple CrispWarm, cinnamon-scented comfort food made of stewed apples and topped with a sweet, crumbly, granola-like crust… is there anything better? Apple crisp caught on during the 20th century as an alternative to apple pie and became hugely popular in the 1980s when Americans learned President Reagan was a fan of its Southern cousin, Apple Brown Betty.  Its popularity as a vehicle for vanilla ice cream was later eclipsed by bread pudding and all its iterations.  But apples are much more nutritious than bread, especially if you don't peel them, so this one gets our vote for a well-deserved comeback. Get our recipe for an Apple Cranberry Crisp.  5 Fruit CobblerLike apple crisp, fruit cobblers have found themselves unfairly upstaged by the constant parade of newer and richer takes on dessert (hello, Cronut, we're talking about you).  But just because fruit cobblers aren't so easy to find these days, that doesn't mean you can't make this tasty, biscuit-topped-fruit dessert at home, especially if you happen to have a wonderful recipe handy. Get our recipe for Blueberry Peach Cobbler.  How many of these 33 nostalgic childhood snacks do you remember?6 Apple TurnoverEven if you'd never consider eating an apple turnover out of your hand, it's still, at heart, a ""hand pie. "" Hand-sized and portable, hand pies have been around since ancient times, although it appears no one thought to use apples and puff pastry until sometime during the 19th century.  What makes us wish it were more readily available these days is that it's inherently portion-controllable.  Luckily, we've got a great Apple Turnover Recipe. 7 Sticky Toffee PuddingSticky toffee pudding, a sweet, sticky, steamed dessert combining toffee and dates, first came into vogue during the 1970s in the U. K.  Unfortunately, it seems to have lost quite a bit of ""steam"" since then.  But why not bring it back, especially if it's in the form of a fiber-rich cake studded with sweet pears and dates? This treat is best enjoyed it with a nice cup of joe. Get our recipe for Sticky Toffee Date Cake.  And why is it that no one makes these 15 retro summer foods anymore?8 Molten Chocolate CakeMolten chocolate cake, sometimes known as ""lava cake,"" is a chocolate cake with a thick, warm, lava-like chocolate center that ""erupts"" when the cake is cracked with a fork.  It was first introduced to Americans in the 1980s at top-tier French restaurants in New York City.  Most of those restaurants are long gone, and you don't see lava cake around much anymore either.  But we miss it.  That's why we learned to make it ourselves. Get our recipe for Molten Chocolate Cake.  9 Bananas FosterBananas Foster, in which bananas are sautéed in a combination of sugar, butter, and rum and then set aflame—briefly, to burn off only the alcohol content—was invented in the 1950s at Brennan's restaurant in New Orleans.  It quickly caught ""fire"" throughout the rest of the country, but over the intervening decades, enthusiasm for the theatrical dessert waned.  Although you can still find Bananas Foster at Brennan's, it's rarely seen on menus elsewhere.  But if you're missing the flavor of warm, sweet caramelized bananas, we have a recipe that delivers precisely that. Get our recipe for Banana Walnut Bourbon French Toast.  10 Traditional Coca-Cola CakeCoca-Cola Cake, which, as the name implies, is made using actual Coca-Cola, is a sweet, moist chocolate cake topped with sweet, gooey chocolate glaze.  It first appeared as a printed recipe in the 1950s and enjoyed a comeback when Cracker Barrel added it to the menu in 1997.  It's been keeping a fairly low profile these days, and we're not sure why, but we'd love to see that change. Get our recipe for Traditional Coca-Cola Cake.  11 BlondiesIn 1896, the world was introduced to ""brownies,"" except they weren't brown in color because they had no chocolate in them.  Rather, they were golden and tasted of molasses.  The name ""brownie"" referred to a mythical elfin creature; ""brownies"" were ""Brownie's Food. "" Those first ""brownies"" were what we think of today as ""blondies. "" Chocolate brownies, which are what we think of when we think of ""brownies,"" were invented nearly a full decade later.  Despite blondies having come first, they've grown less popular as the world has become increasingly enamored with chocolate.  We understand the love for chocolate, but at the same time, we think it would be great if blondies could make a comeback. Get our recipe for Chocolate Chip Blondies.  12 SnickerdoodlesSnickerdoodles are sugar cookies coated in sugar and cinnamon.  Invented in 1891, they were an immediate sensation.  Like blondies, snickerdoodles now suffer from the popularity-undermining affliction known as ""not being made of chocolate. "" And, like blondies, snickerdoodles deserve better. Get our recipe for Snickerdoodle Cookies.  13 Oatmeal CookiesOatmeal cookies have been around far longer than chocolate chip cookies.  But while they've had their moments in the spotlight, oatmeal cookies have always been the ""Jan"" to chocolate chip cookies' ""Marcia. "" And fans of television's early '70s hit The Brady Bunch know that it's always ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. "" The thing is, we're also fans of Jan, which is to say, we believe oatmeal cookies have gotten a raw deal.  Let's give them a little love, even if it means adding some chocolate chips to the batter. Get our recipe for Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies.  14 Gingerbread CookiesGingerbread cookies have been around since the mid-17th century, which is to say they were making mouths happy long before all those ""more popular"" cookies were even born.  Of course, we all know what happened.  As those other cookies came into being, their popularity skyrocketed, while gingerbread cookies increasingly became ""yesterday's news. "" But we believe gingerbread cookies deserve better, especially when they're homemade and iced. Get our recipe for Gingerbread Cookies.  15 Lemon Chiffon CakeLight, airy, and bursting with lemon flavor, lemon chiffon cake was invented in the mid-1920s, but its recipe was kept a secret until 1947 when Betty Crocker shared it with the world.  Sadly, that was lemon chiffon cake's big moment, and it has not seen anything even close to that level of popularity since.  We think that might change, however, once word gets around you can make it in an Instant Pot. Get our recipe for Instant Pot Lemon Cake, and don't miss these 20 Instant Pot hacks every cook should know. 16 Banana SplitPutting ice cream into a banana boat and topping it with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and cherry wasn't just a good idea when the banana split was invented in 1907.  It was a genius idea then, and it continues to be now, even if the good ole banana split has been, over time, overshadowed by bigger, more elaborate ice cream desserts. Get our recipe for a Grilled Banana Split.  17 Malt-Shop Style MilkshakesSpeaking of ice cream concoctions, let's not forget the old-fashioned milkshakes they used to make to order in malt shops from days gone by.  You'd sit at the counter, order your shake, and watch as the ""soda jerk"" (as he was called without derision) grabbed a metal shaker, plopped in some vanilla ice cream, squirted in some flavored syrup, and then whipped up your milkshake using an old-fashioned milkshake machine.  These days, milkshakes tend to be churned out like soft-serve from pre-made mixes at fast food joints.  But who's to say you can't make them the good old-fashioned way yourself?Get our recipe for Old-Fashioned Milkshakes.  18 Baked AlaskaOne of America's most iconic desserts, Baked Alaska is ice cream surrounded by cake surrounded by meringue that's either browned quickly in the oven or given the flambé treatment tableside.  Baked Alaska attained its peak popularity in the mid-20th century, but because it's essentially ice cream cake enveloped in meringue (which consists of sweetened whipped egg whites) and offers an occasion to create quite a spectacle (if you decide to go the flambé route), we can't figure out why it's not more widely available these days.  For now, you can find a recipe for a brownie-based Baked Alaska from Sally's Baking Addiction. 19 Crêpes SuzetteCrêpes Suzette is another fun, fancy, flambé dessert from days gone by.  Perfect in its simplicity, it's a crepe doused in butter and orange-flavored liqueur and then set dramatically aflame (to burn off most of the alcohol in the liqueur while imparting a deep orange flavor into the dessert itself). It's difficult to find a classic recipe for this beloved blast from the past, but this one from Half-Baked Harvest is pretty close, although it's served drizzled with yogurt rather than set aflame, and instead of orange, it uses Meyer lemon.  If it's the deep orange flavor you seek, you might want to give our Cinnamon Orange Lava Cakes recipe a whirl. 20 Pineapple Upside-Down CakeAlthough Hawaii didn't become a state until 1959, by 1906, James Dole had built his first pineapple cannery, and by the 1920s, canned pineapple bad become so ubiquitous in the U. S.  that pineapple upside-down cake (so named because when it's baking, the pineapple is at the bottom of the cake) became a trend. Get the recipe from Averie Cooks.  21 Chocolate FondueFondue dates back to 17th century Switzerland, but traditionally, it was made with cheese.  But chocolate fondue was invented in the early 1960s right here in the U. S. , immediately becoming a huge trend among the hip, giving rise to ""fondue parties"" and restaurants devoted entirely to fondue.  Today, chocolate fondue is rarely seen, which is unfortunate because it's fun to play with your food, and it's a delicious delivery system for fresh fruit.  If you'd like to throw a fondue party, you can find an easy recipe for chocolate fondue at Chelsea's Messy Apron, or if you prefer to serve your fruit pre-dipped, then we highly recommend our recipe for Dark Chocolate Dipped Bananas. 22 Black Forest CakeBlack Forest Cake, which dates back to 16th century Germany, is chocolate cake brushed with cherry Schnapps and layered with cherries (or, more often, cherry pie filling) and whipped cream.  By the middle of the 20th century, it was Germany's best-known cake and had also become well-known in the U. S. , particularly in cities popular among German emigrés.  These days, black forest cake has all but disappeared from the mainstream, although we did find this recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction, and fans of the arguably perfect combination of chocolate and cherry can get their fix with our recipe for Molten Lava Chocolate Cherry Cake. 23 German Chocolate CakeChocolate aficionados might take issue with the name ""German Chocolate Cake"" because this very sweet and mild layer cake gets at least as much, if not more, flavor from pecans and coconut.  Still others might take issue with the fact that ""German"" doesn't refer to the country but to the last name of the guy who invented the particular baking chocolate with which this cake was first made.  Nevertheless, German Chocolate Cake was an American favorite during the mid-20th century.  It's rarely seen these days, haven taken a backseat to far more chocolatey chocolate desserts.  But it's as delicious as it ever was, and we found a great recipe for it from Sally's Baking Addiction. Got questions about chocolate? We've got answers, lots and lots of answers. 24 Fresh Berries with ZabaioneFresh Berries with Zabaione (also spelled ""Zabaglione"") is a traditional Italian dessert consisting of fresh berries, drizzled generously with a custard-y sauce composed of just three ingredients: egg yolks, sugar, and marsala wine (although some variations use port wine or moscato d'asti).  Although zabaione dates back to 15th century Italy, it was causing quite a stir back in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, when it was as much a default dessert order for some as tiramisu seems to have become.  Some even say that tiramisu derived from zabaione. Although it's hard to find today, you can make it yourself with this recipe from Tania's Kitchen.  Or, if you prefer a healthier version of an Italian-inspired strawberry delivery system, then you'll want to try our recipe for Strawberries with Mascarpone Cream. 25 FruitcakeWe can't say fruitcake has ever been ""forgotten,"" exactly.  Fruitcake has always been around, and folks are very conscious of that around Christmastime.  The problem is that many regard the prospect of eating fruitcake with a least some measure of trepidation.  And that's putting it mildly.  But it doesn't have to be that way.  Fruitcake, when it's homemade with fresh ingredients, can be quite the revelation.  Don't believe us?

The arrival of some feisty young males has “truly impressed” staff, the zoo said, especially when they break out their dance moves.  Video released by the zoo on September 16 shows the dancing behavior, which involves males dropping to the ground, fanning their wings and swaying from side to side.  According to zookeper Katie Jones, the dancing is a territorial or courtship behavior.  “Ostriches are typically nomadic but around breeding season we see an increase of territorial displays,” Jones said.  Older ostriches, she said, are happy to leave “the dancing to the testosterone-filled younger boys. ” Among those, the zoo said, is Frank, who is celebrating his 27th birthday soon.  “Ostriches have a lifespan of 40–50 years, so our older boys – Frank and Pinky – are roughly middle-aged,” Jones said.

2020-09-08 15:48:11#world#Make Your Beauty Routine More Effective With This One Simple Challenge#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/beauty-routine-more-effective-one-154811227.html#https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2o.Y.ZJsnNsLMMdAZA6R4g--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9MTAyNDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/refinery29_778/b48663ef68bf0ea0ec3d2c3ed08b31d9#en#1.0#www.yahoo.com#As a beauty editor, I’ve tried some pretty extreme self-care practices in the name of serviceable journalism (“We Tried [insert unheard-of beauty treatment here], So You Don’t Have To”).  So, when Crabtree & Evelyn recently tasked me with approaching self-care through a simpler lens — one that only required a mere shift in my perspective — I was intrigued.  The challenge? Channel each of the five senses — sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch — with my self-care practices throughout the week to see how it affected my overall mood and if it breathed any new life into my regular routine.  Would paying more attention to the feel of each skin-care product I used change my application of it? Would being more intentional about the scents I sought out help me better de-stress? Equipped with a fresh mindset and beauty products from Crabtree & Evelyn, a brand that prides itself on using special ingredients to create these unique, transformative textures (and its new look — a major rebranding done with the intention to return to its naturalistic roots — is so chic), I sought to find out.  See how it all went down, below.  As someone who tends to speed through her skin-care routine in the morning (anything to get to my first cup of coffee quicker), I decided to slow down and appreciate the different textures and consistencies of all my various steps — like the way my toner forms a thin puddle in my palm before I press it into my skin or how my moisturizer, which is more viscous in consistency, spreads across my face like warm butter.  Allowing myself time to appreciate the various textures, I was also allowing more time for absorption.  When I think of the type of product that lends itself most to an indulgent application experience, however, I think of a rich body crème.  So, I grabbed my Crabtree & Evelyn Velvet Body Melt and mentally transported myself to the spa (physically, my bathroom).  Upon opening the jar, I was hit with the fresh scent of roses, lemon, and vetiver.  I dug my fingers into the tub, leaving behind a very satisfying imprint in the thick balm.  When I spread the cream onto my legs, it melted into a silky oil, effortlessly gliding across my skin (I credit the soothing murumuru butter and softening mallow in the formula for that).  Transforming from a rich, indulgent cream into a slippery-smooth oil, this unique hydrator left my skin feeling thirst-quenched and thoroughly pampered, from head to toe. Takeaway: When it comes to application order, there’s a general rule that you start with lightweight products and work your way towards the heaviest, which allows for each one to properly sink in.  Paying more attention to the consistencies of my products forced me to adopt a leisurely pace.  It felt like I was making the most out of each one, and it made for a more relaxing, spa-like experience. DashDividers_1_500x100DashDividers_1_500x100Whether it’s a news podcast, a pop album, or a viral video, I am constantly listening to something.  So much so, that it’s often hard for me to turn my brain off at night.  In an attempt to be more mindful about the sounds I surround myself with, I decided to retire the headphones for the day and listen to the natural sounds of the world around me, instead — by going on a nature walk.  I swiped on a hydrating lip balm (since my lips are always chapped), lathered on the SPF 50 (because, always), and headed out to a tree-lined dirt road a few minutes away. As I wandered down the path, I paid extra attention to every little sound.  I listened to the twigs snap and leaves crunch beneath my feet.  I noticed the way my shoes sunk ever so slightly into the damp ground from the previous night’s rain storm.  I listened to the birds singing their many medleys, from sharp, staccato chirps to sweet, singsongy whistles.  I heard the tall marsh plants brush against each other in the breeze and the soft lapping of the water in the nearby pond.  It was a full-on symphony. Takeaway: Getting fresh air and listening to the natural sounds around me, as obvious as it sounds, was such an effective way to feel immediately present.  It left me with a feeling of mindfulness that lingered long after I returned home.  Not to mention, my screen time for the day plummeted, which always feels like a win. DashDividers_1_500x100DashDividers_1_500x100There is no rhyme or reason to my skin-care storage.  I keep my most-used products randomly spread out around my sink in whatever position I last left them, with no designated parking spot to return to after each use.  So today, I decided to tap into my inner beauty influencer and arrange my skin-care collection in the most aesthetically pleasing way possible — which, after scrolling through a mere fraction of the 2. 4 million TopShelf posts on IG, I decided was color-coordination. Upon starting this endeavor, it became immediately clear to me that most of my skin-care products fall into two color categories: earthy tones and millennial pink (save a few outliers, of course).  In order to make the most of this organizational method, I decided to store the products that didn’t fit into either category and highlighted only those that did.  After arranging the black bottles by similar shape and by height order, and mirroring the same placements with the pink products, I was left with a satisfyingly chic arrangement.  Honestly, it was harder than it looked!Takeaway: While the end result was certainly a visual upgrade, this was probably the least practical experiment of the challenge thus far.  Color-coordinating my products meant having to table a few essentials that I would normally keep close at hand.  So unless your skin-care collection conveniently hits the full spectrum of a rainbow palette, I’d say stick to organizing by product type or in order of your routine, instead. DashDividers_1_500x100DashDividers_1_500x100Skin-care and nutrition are, understandably, very tied: If you’re conscious of what you put in your body, you’re likely conscious of what you put on your skin, as well.  Many who seek out things like free radical-fighting antioxidants in skin-care products will do the same with the foods they ingest, too (dark berries, leafy greens, etc. ).  So, I decided to treat my tastebuds to a triple-berry smoothie, swapping out my usual bowl of cereal for more nutrient-based energy in the a. m. , instead.  Dark-berry fruits are high in fiber and packed with antioxidants and vitamins, and I felt much more energized — and satisfyingly full — after finishing it. For my morning caffeine fix, I poured myself some iced coffee.  To make my cold brew slightly sweeter — and give it an autumn-inspired spin — I added a dash of Crabtree & Evelyn’s Fresh Harvest Syrup, a thick, cozy, sweet-but-spicy blend of maple and ginger derived from a Vermont-based maple syrup farm that served as a perfect, more special alternative to regular table sugar (plus, ginger has a ton of proven health benefits).  derived from local maple syrup farm in VermontFinally, to make the most of the day’s theme, I applied a gourmand-inspired face mask to energize my skin: Crabtree & Evelyn’s Revitalise + Pulp Polish Face Mask.  The bouncy, marmalade-like formula is jam-packed with fruit to help restore skin’s natural glow, featuring apple complex to exfoliate and moisturize, apricot seed powder to gently polish, and blackcurrant seed oil to keep soften skin with protective Omega-6s.  It smelled so good that I was tempted to eat it.  (I didn’t. ) I massaged the gel-like mask onto my skin, activating the apple complex and allowing the finely milled apricot seed powder to gently buff away dead skin cells.  After washing it off 15 minutes later, my skin felt noticeably smoother and appeared extra plump. Takeaway: If today taught me anything, it’s that if your skin-care ingredient list reads like a smoothie recipe, you’re probably onto something good.  I felt much more refreshed after focusing on nourishing myself from the inside out. DashDividers_1_500x100DashDividers_1_500x100Scent — along with being extremely subjective (one whiff of my first-ever fragrance sends me right back to middle school) — is a powerful way to influence your mood.  So for the final leg of this challenge, I decided to dabble in the world of aromatherapy and seek out scents that would help me feel more productive, relaxed, or awake. I started the day by spritzing on an earthy, uplifting scent: Crabtree & Evelyn’s Raw Instinct Scent has notes of zingy apple, natural eucalyptus, and a smoky, wood base that gives it depth and longevity to last — and evolve — throughout the day.  I misted the subtly sweet, airy scent onto my wrists and let it settle into my skin. While working, I sprinkled cinnamon (improves concentration!) on top of my coffee and broke out the peppermint tea (stimulates mind!) to pick me up out of my midday slump.  By the end of the day, I was ready to fully wind down.  I curled up in my bed, grabbed my book, and broke out a massive candle to set the vibe.  Featuring ginger flower, eucalyptus, and cedar wood, this particular candle was just spicy enough to keep me alert as I read, but calming, as well, to help me drift off to sleep soon after. Takeaway: I’m so used to associating smell with nostalgia and memories that it was fascinating to try scents in a much more proactive way.  My next challenge? Expanding my essential oil collection.

Sure, you'll see fast results if you try some kind of fad diet, but it won't last long.  Diets aren't sustainable, which is why it's important to learn healthy eating habits for the long term. Eating healthy is about balance.  It's about enjoying a glass of wine and not feeling guilty about it.  It's about learning how to intuitively eat, listening to your body's cues, and not attaching emotions to any of your meals.  Healthy eating habits can be cultivated with a few simple changes—changes that won't feel overwhelming or restrictive on your eating.  We now know that restricted eating doesn't work, so instead, here are a few healthy eating habits you can incorporate into daily life that will lead you closer to a healthier lifestyle.  And yes, it can even help with losing those pesky extra pounds. 1 Stock up on healthy snacks. Snacking is inevitable, we all love to do it! Craving a little afternoon snack (or a mid-morning bite between breakfast and lunch) shouldn't be the reason we turn to salty and fatty junk foods.  Instead, stock your pantry with healthier snacks you truly enjoy.  Fruit and peanut butter are obviously great options, but you could also snag popcorn, nut or date bars, cheese sticks, and snap pea crisps. 2 Fill half your plate with veggies. Pile on the veggies! Not only does it fill your plate up quickly, but it also provides a ton of nutrients.  Plus, they're low in calories.  Salad greens are easy, but you could also add roasted vegetables like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, green beans, squash, carrots, and more. 3 Drink water throughout the day. Water wards off dehydration (which causes you to want to eat more), but it's also incredibly important for your digestion.  Plus, if you're drinking water throughout the day, you're less likely to drink other sugary drinks—like soda and sugary cocktails.  Not sure how much you need to be drinking? Here's an easy way to calculate how much water to drink. 4 Make frozen smoothie packs. Making smoothies is a lot easier when you have the supplies on hand! Stock up your freezer with some of your favorite frozen fruits, or even divide up some frozen fruits in smoothie packs.  One easy smoothie pack to make includes 1/2 banana, 1/2 cup of berries, and 1 cup of kale (loosely packed).  When you're reading for a smoothie, mix with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk and either 1 tablespoon of peanut butter or 1 scoop of protein powder.  This works well as a snack, but can even be filling enough for a meal!5 Swap with whole grains. Whole-grain carbohydrates are loaded with dietary fiber, which is the best food you can have for weight loss.  Swapping out your white, refined carbohydrates for whole-grain carbohydrates and complex carbs is actually a lot easier than you think.  You can find whole-grain pasta, tortillas, bread, crackers, and more. 6 Roast sheet pan dinners. Frying and sauteeing are easy ways to cook dinner, but if you're not careful, you can easily load it up with lots of oil, which piles on the calories.  Instead, roast your dinner in the oven on a sheet pan.  Sheet pan dinners are easy to throw together and easy in terms of controlling how much oil you end up using.  Plus, they're super tasty, and the dish clean-up later is minimal. RELATED: Your ultimate supermarket survival guide is here!7 Sip on seltzer. Water is good to drink, but it can get boring pretty quickly.  Find a few seltzers you love that can change up your usual water-drinking routine.  Plus, by choosing flavored seltzer, you can easily replace your sugary sodas and other beverages that are full of empty calories. 8 Portion your food. Portioning out your food doesn't mean restricting your food! It means properly portioning out the right amount of food for each meal.  For a normal lunch of dinner plate, it's good to have at least 4 to 5 oz.  of protein, 1-2 cups of vegetables, 1/2 cup (or 1 serving) of a complex carb, and a serving of healthy fats.  This plate is full and filling, and you won't feel like you're missing out. 9 Choose one dessert for the day. Have a sweet tooth? You don't have to eliminate your favorite sweets completely.  Just like portioning out your food, plan your dessert for the day and portion it correctly.  If you love ice cream, have a scoop of ice cream.  Dark chocolate? Enjoy a serving of it.  Are you more of a brownie person? Enjoy one warmed up with a dollop of whipped cream.  It will satisfy your sweet craving and you won't overdo it on the calories. Or make your own sweet treat from our list of 73+ Best Healthy Dessert Recipes. #https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/TOFUBbTD8#TOFUBbTD8#44#4#648#0#0

You don’t have to be a solstice-bothering modern-day Druid to experience the sense of renewal that it brings; dawn is the purest expression of a fresh start, a chance to do things differently, to watch a brand new day begin to unfold.  Perhaps some of this psychological cleansing comes from the fact that you will almost certainly have to put in a bit of effort, or find yourself doing something out of the ordinary, to witness this daily phenomenon.  For those of us lucky enough not to work night shifts, seeking out a spectacular sunrise may require an alarm clock, plenty of coffee and a journey in the dark, wrapped up warm.  Does that make it a more satisfying event than sunset, with all its gaudy brilliance, witnessed with friends over a drink, by a beach, as half the world begins its slumbers? Let’s not compare the two.  But it’s certainly true that you will be in good company for your early start, as a dawn chorus of birds joins you in salute.  They are welcoming the day, just as you are – and as the writers below do, in a celebration of the most memorable sunrises they have experienced around the world. #https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/I5vMsQYyM#I5vMsQYyM#171#2#2631#0#0

Speaking to Storyful, owner Tammy Tunison said “Junior loves head-butting the deer, which he thinks is a goat,” but said she filmed this moment because it was the first time Alex stood on the swing.  Tunison purchased a swing made for toddlers, but figured figured it was “a perfect size” for her animals.  “My goats loved it,” she said.  “Alex was the first one to try the swing.  He learned right away how to get on it,” she added.  “As I was filming I realized…he was using his head, legs, and butt to make the swing move.  I could not believe it.  A goat that can swing himself.  He did this for over 30 minutes!,” Tunison said.  Credit: Tammy Tunison via Storyful#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/yZ1lVuuLL#yZ1lVuuLL#74#4#4626#0#0

Here's a look back at some of the most defining moments in modern American fast food, one iconic item at a time. For more, check out 15 Classic American Desserts That Deserve a Comeback. Don't forget to sign up for our newsletter to get the latest restaurant news delivered straight to your inbox. 1 McDonald's Big MacProbably the most iconic burger on the planet, the Big Mac from McDonald's is the OG fast food burger.  It's the burger that taught us what fast food burgers could look like.  Now in its 52nd year, the signature burger is ordered a whopping 550 million times annually.  Once you dissect it, however, it's pretty simple—two beef patties, special sauce, cheese, pickles, and onions, on a sesame bun.  Here's What Happens to Your Body When You Eat a Big Mac Every Day. 2 Popeyes Chicken SandwichThis iconic chicken sandwich was only rolled out last year, but it has already gone down in American fast food history as the most buzzed about fast food item of the past decade.  Sure, it has a juicy, perfectly crispy piece of chicken nestled between a brioche bun with pickles and mayo, but what this sandwich actually showed us is that in this day and age, it isn't enough to simply taste good, you also need to have a savvy social media presence.  Once Popeye's tweeted ""y'all good?"" at their main competitor Chick-fil-A, the sandwich was well on its way to selling out within two weeks of launching.  Read more about the iconic sandwich here. 3 Taco Bell's Doritos Locos TacosOnce Taco Bell decided to collaborate with another food icon—Doritos—it was only a matter of time before they were to create the chain's most popular menu item.  Doritos Locos Tacos were added to the restaurant's menu in 2012 and have since sold in the billions.  Actually, it's been reported that about a million are sold EACH DAY.  Talk about a restaurant that knows its audience.  Here's why Your Favorite Taco Bell Location Is About to Look Very Different. 4 Subway's $5 FootlongSubway's subs wouldn't be what they are had it not been for the ingenious 2008 promotional campaign that touted their incredible value—for a mere $5, you get a foot-long sandwich.  Unfortunately, throughout the years, the types of subs you can get for this price and the participating locations have dwindled.  While the $5 Footlong is mostly gone from Subway, this product (and its catchy jingle) really put the restaurant's sandwiches on the map. 5 McDonald's Apple PieOne of the fast food desserts with most staying power, the hand-held apple pie from McDonald's has been around for an incredible stretch of 52 years (just like the Big Mac!).  While the recipe has had over 40 different iterations over the years, it has firmly remained in its signature cardboard sleeve.  Today's recipe features a baked lattice crust, and a blend of Golden Delicious, Jonagold, Rome, Gala, Ida Red, and Fuji apples.  Read more on why You Might've Noticed That McDonald's Apple Pies Taste a Little Different. 6 Dunkin's MunchkinsWe love our non-conventionally shaped baked treats, and Munchkins seem to have filled that hole in our hearts perfectly.  When they started being sold at Dunkin' Donuts in 1972, the adorable donut holes were named after characters from The Wizard of Oz and were primarily marketed to kids.  Nowadays, hordes of fans young and old consume millions of them every year. 7 Sonic's Cherry LimeadeOne of Sonic's most popular menu items is actually a beverage.  The chain's Cherry Limeade, a sweet, tart, and bubbly soda, is equal parts delicious and retro, which has garnered it a cult following.  To honor the success they've had with this signature drink, Sonic incorporated cherry-red letters in their new logo this year, while a big neon-lit cherry is now a prominent feature of their updated restaurant design. 8 Burger King's Chicken FriesSure, we've seen bite-sized pieces of perfectly crispy chicken before with the ubiquitous chicken nuggets, but chicken bits shaped like french fries for ultimate dippability? Now that is some Burger King genius.  After a years-long hiatus, during which fans tirelessly campaigned for their return, the chicken fries came back in 2015 as a permanent menu item.  And we've never looked back since. 9 White Castle's Impossible Slider Before the Impossible Whopper and Dunkin's Beyond Breakfast Sausage Sandwich, there was the Impossible Slider from White Castle.  That's right, White Castle was a pioneer when it came to serving plant-based meat in one of their iconic creations.  The chain started serving the Impossible slider as early as April 2018, before rolling it out nationwide in September of that year.  We Tried the White Castle Impossible Slider.  Here's Our Review. 10 McDonald's Egg McMuffinThe Egg McMuffin is to breakfast fast food what the Big Mac is to fast food burgers.  Invented in 1972 by a franchise owner in Santa Barbara, CA, the breakfast sandwich was meant to resemble Eggs Benedict.  But it became so much more than an imitation—a breakfast icon in itself, which has withstood the test of time and prevailed on the McDonald's menu for decades. 11 Starbucks PSLsIn 2003, Starbucks had a brilliant idea: to create a seasonal limited-time Fall drink that'll keep fans coming back year after year.  Hence, the Pumpkin Spice Latte was born.  The PSL has become as synonymous with Fall as apple pie, and is actually credited with propelling the pumpkin spice flavor into a full-fledged cultural phenomenon. 12 Panda Express' Orange ChickenPanda Express struck gold with the invention of Orange Chicken, which straddles both Chinese and American flavor palettes perfectly with its unique sweet, spicy, and savory notes.  Developed in 1987 by chef Andy Kho, the dish capitalizes on its Chinese inspiration and American craveability factor.  And it has become so synonymous with Chinese cuisine, you'll find it on most Chinese restaurant menus nationwide.  Read why This Is the Safest Restaurant Chain Right Now. 13 KFC's Double DownThe no-bun, double-chicken sandwich was the very first fast food sandwich served without bread.  As such, it's credited with providing limitless fast food inspiration, showing that anything is possible (and sellable).  And while we appreciate this bacon-cheese-chicken sandwich for what it meant for American ingenuity, it's no longer available at KFC. 14 Pizza Hut's Stuffed Crust PizzaPossibly the food innovation of the century, stuffing the pizza crust with cheese is one of Pizza Hut's (and fast food's) most iconic moments.  The seminal work took place in 1995, and the landscape of pizza has never quite been the same.  We now want our pie to surprise and delight us just like it did back then.

They are also very simple to attract to any back yard.  They adore brightly coloured fruit such as mango, oranges, and red grapes.  This ingenious feeder is as simple as slicing an orange in half and sticking it on a tree branch.  Orioles will seek out the best places to feed and they will even bring their young to the same spots.  Orioles have a unique and interesting method of feeding, referred to as ""gaping"".  Although they do eat by closing their beaks around food, they also use their beaks in the opposite direction, inserting the tip into soft food such as a orange and then opening their beaks to create a trough or ""gape"".  This gape fills with juice which they slurp up or eat by using their beaks in typical fashion.  Orioles are also very fond of grape jelly, which can be used to lure them to a back yard feeder.  With just a little research, the right foods can be found for each bird species and a feeder can be used to attract a person's favourite birds.  Watching beautifully coloured birds so close up can provide hours of joy for any nature lover. "#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/A6emSxcRR#A6emSxcRR#286#15#4848#0#0

However, your handy, reusable cube-maker can be used for so many more hacks than just simply chilling water. ""Freezing things this way in an ice cube tray is a great way to use leftover bits and bobs and to have them portioned for the future.  You can let the cubes freeze solid, at least overnight, then pop them out and store them in a zipper-lock bag if you want to use your tray for something else,"" says Hannah Crowley, executive editor of tastings and testings at America's Test Kitchen in Brookline, Massachusetts. So yes, there are tons of ice cube tray hacks that you might be surprised to uncover how much these trays can do! Try these 13 tricks to make the most of your ice cube tray and create flavor-filled food in a flash.  And for more hacks, don't miss these 52 Life-Changing Kitchen Hacks That'll Make You Enjoy Cooking Again. 1 Chill coffee without watering it down""Chilling coffee with regular ice cubes can lead to a watered-down product.  Freezing brewed coffee in ice cube trays allows you to add that 'ice,' but as it melts, it's a continual dose of coffee,"" says Chanel Hayes, executive chef at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts. If you prefer your coffee with a splash of dairy, freeze milk cubes, suggests Burt Cho, chef at Katsuya in Hollywood, California. RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter to get daily recipes and food news in your inbox!2 Preserve leftover wineHave some bonus Beaujolais? Pour it into small portions for easy access later on. ""I like to store wine in an ice cube tray,"" Crowley says.  ""It's a good way to use up the last bit of a bottle, especially after a party, and then I have some the next time I want to make a pan sauce or some soup.  That way I don't have to use any of whatever I'm drinking that night!""RELATED: Your ultimate restaurant and supermarket survival guide is here!3 Save stockIf you've gone through the effort of simmering up a pot of homemade stock or broth, you want to make the most of it, and that's where the ice cube tray comes in. ""I like to make a big batch of stock and store the leftovers in ice trays.  This allows you to choose the quantity you need, so you don't have to thaw large portions,"" Hayes says. RELATED: This 7-day smoothie diet will help you shed those last few pounds. 4 Extend the life of herbsStore herbs in broth, melted butter, or oil—the possibilities are truly endless! Dice herbs and cover with some liquid substance, then freeze to preserve summer's best to use all year long.  Try the herb cubes melted into soups, sauces, or stir-fries, or simply melt a pat atop a grilled steak. 5 Baby your DIY baby foodInstead of grabbing a jar, defrost a couple of cubes. ""I enjoy making my child's food—and knowing that it was made from scratch with fresh ingredients,"" Hayes says.  She dedicates a day to meal prep a few different items (such as sweet potatoes, squash, and carrots), purée them, and then freeze each in a separate ice cube tray. ""This way, my kid can have a variety of items in one day, and they're all quick to heat up,"" she says. And when you don't have time to make it homemade, here are The Best Baby Food Brands to Buy, According to Nutritionists. 6 Make the most of fruitBerries and bananas can go bad before you know it, so freezing them in cubes is a way to make them last a lot longer than they typically would. ""Purée and freeze fresh fruit at its prime, then try these as a replacement for store-bought frozen fruit for smoothies,"" Hayes says. Or, you can pour the final few ounces of your 100% fruit juice into a tray and freeze it to later use them to top seltzers or cocktails with colorful, tasty cubes. 7 Build better buttermilk pancakesA typical single-serving homemade pancake recipe calls for about 1/3 cup of buttermilk.  Too bad it often comes in half-gallon containers, right? The solution: Fill one-ounce wells two-thirds of the way full with the rest of the bottle of buttermilk, then defrost four cubes to build batter for another short stack any time. And while you're making flapjacks, check out these 13 Common Pancake Mistakes—and How to Fix Them. 8 Waste no more egg whitesUsing egg yolks for custards, ice cream, or hollandaise? Preserve the whites for another day by filling each ice cube well with one white.  Then, you can thaw as many as you need for your recipe in the fridge overnight and use them to add a protein boost to your menu. Use egg whites as the ""glue"" for spices on candied nuts, combine them with whole eggs to bring a stir-fry together, or scramble them with leftover vegetables and proteins. 9 Build a better (stiffer) bourbon drinkCalling all cocktail aficionados: Stock up on larger or spherical ice cube trays. ""A ball of ice is better than a cube because the less surface area that is exposed to the warm liquid, the slower the ice will melt.  A sphere of ice will melt slightly slower than a cube of ice, so you can chill the drink without quickly diluting it,"" says Mario Segura, chef at Umami Burger in Los Angeles, California. 10 Create crystal-clear cocktail coolersIf you want your ice to be as clear and cool as your favorite cocktail bar, try Crowley's trick. ""Restaurant ice is bubble-free if it comes from commercial ice machines that have purifiers and freeze the water really fast,"" she says.  ""You can make similarly-sharp cubes at home by boiling distilled water and freezing it—no need to cool first.  This makes clear ice, like all the fancy bars serve now, and the clear ice actually stays frozen longer than regular ice, making it perfect for cocktails. ""11 Chill caramelized onionsA bit nutty, a bit sweet, a bit tangy—caramelized onions lend a delicious flavor to soups, sauces, and pasta.  What we're not so wild about is the 45 minutes or so it takes to get them lusciously jammy.  Luckily, they freeze up just fine if you pack them into ice cube wells tightly—no other ingredients required.  Caramelize several onions at once, then store in a zip-top bag (with as much of the air pressed out as possible) in the freezer for up to three months. 12 Make speedy chocolate-covered strawberriesBakery-bought chocolate-covered strawberries can cost upwards of $3 each.  Try this ice cube tray hack to save cash.

In this video uploaded to Twitter on July 3, the young animal is seen eating from one of Helen Yanulus’s bird feeders before moving onto the next.  Seeing some movement indoors, the bear is seen making a run for it, and climbing down the deck.  With a largely undeveloped area near her property, Yanulus is accustomed to seeing a variety of wildlife, but she told Storyful that seeing a young bear climbing “up about a story to the top of the deck to investigate our seeds” is a first.

DePace said that three park rangers were with the horses “to ensure their safety” as they cooled off in the water.  She said it was a “very hot day. ” The horses are descendants of domestic animals that reverted to a wild state, according to the National Park Service , who encourage visitors to the island to “enjoy their beauty from a distance. ” Credit: Karen DePace via Storyful#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/vwwMcCeZp#vwwMcCeZp#45#1#6429#0#0

""We came to accompany the task of the inspectors and the Environmental Control brigade of the Ministry, who carry out an exemplary task taking care of the environment, protecting the fauna and controlling contaminating activities throughout the country,"" stressed the Minister of Environment. The first of the sea lions to appear was spotted by local residents on a road by the Gualeguaychú river, in the town of the same name in the province of Entre Ríos.  Days later, Ambiente participated in a new rescue operation for another specimen that was circulating in a private neighborhood located on the banks of the Luján River in the Buenos Aires municipality of Escobar.  The other two sea lions and the elephant seal were found in the following days in the Paraná delta area of ​​the Tigre district, province of Buenos Aires. The Civil Defense of Escobar and Tigre, the Tigre Operations Center (COT) and the Félix de Azara and Temaikèn foundations participated in the relief and assistance of the different animals, in the rescue center the first veterinary controls were carried out.  Once stabilized, a specialized team of inspectors from the national Ministry of Environment transferred the specimens to the Mundo Marino Foundation, where they remained until the present reintegration into the sea. The five animals had entered the delta of the Paraná River.  It is estimated that the reasons that led marine mammals to lose their habitat could be related to climatic events such as storms or floods or extraordinary downspouts, or due to the low supply of food in salty waters that ended up moving them away from their reference routes.

Einstein parrot is also famous for some of his silly quotes and sayings.  Online, Einstein, the talking parrot is popular across many social media platforms.  Einstein’s favorite places to talk at home is perched on the shower wall, in the kitchen on his drawer, and on his screened-in back porch.  As stated on his website, Einstein’s mission statement: “To entertain and bring joy, to foster the human-parrot bond, and to convey that parrots are deserving of immeasurable amounts of patience, nurturing, and companionship. ” Einstein’s website, einsteinparrot. com is designed to inform you about the care of parrots and also entertain you.  As previously mentioned, Einstein is popular on many social media sites such as YouTube @einsteinparrot, Instagram @einsteinparrot, Twitter @einsteinparrot, and Facebook @einsteintexanparrot.  Living with a parrot is a big commitment.  Parrots live a very long time.   A parrot such as Einstein can live to be 50 or 60 years old.  Many larger parrots like Macaws can live to be 100 years old.  They all require a lot of care, proper nutrition, training, time, and patience.  Parrots need a lot of attention and lots of toys and activities to keep from being bored.  Parrots are also expensive, a large cage is an investment, and plenty of play perches to spend out of cage time.  Specialized veterinarian care is also required.  Most of all they require your companionship and a forever home.  Many people decide after the first few years of parrot ownership that the responsibility is too great and the parrots become neglected and sometimes abandoned.  When that happens they are sent to parrot rescue facilities to be adopted by a new family or some spend their lives in sanctuaries.  It is often said, “Having a parrot is much like raising a raising a 2 to 3-year-old child for the rest of your life!”"#https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/fj815ovsY#fj815ovsY#238#20#4491#0#0

Through the application of hot air to the spot where the car has been scratched, the finish liquefies and spreads itself out like new again.  The re-mendable polymer finish is expected to be introduced onto the market in the near future. #https://sunnybot.org/goodnews/web/en/z2BmNBITx#z2BmNBITx#163#2#9589#0#0

The choice of song is apparently a tribute to the band's road crew who, the video claims, are ""the best in the world"".  Well, apart from one thing.  The singer then goes on to explain that Irish crews have a penchant for performing a certain Led Zeppelin song when setting up the band's equipment.  ""Wherever you go in the world,"" he says, ""whatever venue it is, whether it's the Olympia or the 3Arena or Madison Square Garden.  You walk into the venue, it's a big moment, and you'll hear a song we said we'd never play.  ""That's right, Stairway To Heaven.  These professionals believe they play this better than the band. . .  and you know? It might be true. ""The pair then go on to play the song.  Well, part of it.  With The Edge providing some rather lovely vocal harmonies. ""It makes me wonder,"" Bono concludes, ""if they're not right.  That they can play the tune better. ""We'll leave that for you to decide.
