Memphis Inner City Rugby, founded in the southern city in 2012, earned a Sport for Reduced Racial Inequalities Collective Impact Award, guaranteeing “significant investment” and off-field resource support, said Beyond Sport, a nonprofit which works for social change worldwide.  The award was backed by Dick’s Sporting Goods Foundation. Shane Young, who co-founded MICR while working as a teacher but who now runs the show full-time, told the Guardian the award was “really special to all of our students and coaches, especially alumni coaches who have really done something special here in Tennessee, all the way back to our first teams ever”. MICR coaches and players, Young said, had “taken on and embraced a sport they had never heard of.  And, you know, the demographic playing playing rugby here in the south, and Tennessee was, at that time, very homogenous. > We had to cancel a rugby season like everybody else … over the summer and spring we delivered thousands of bags of food> > Shane Young“It took a lot of bravery, courage, trust and spirit for our kids to break down those barriers and do the amazing things they’ve done, the trails they’ve blazed and they’ve broken.  This is for them.  They really deserve this recognition. ”MICR aims to get young Tennesseans scrummaging, passing, kicking and tackling but it also focuses on off-field education and development, aiming to send hookers, props and flankers who might otherwise miss out on college to play rugby while studying for four-year degrees. That pipeline, Young said, “is working well.  College rugby scholarships are a very sort of wild, wild west landscape right now.  And it’s hard to traverse.  But we’re in a good position to help our kids through that confusing opportunity. “From our class of 2019, one [Carlicia Beam] is now a student at Dartmouth and one [KaDerrius Campbell] is at Bowdoin.  We’ve had students at Tufts, playing a national championship in division three.  And then the University of Memphis, it’s becoming normal for the Tigers roster to have Memphis Inner City Rugby alumni, staying locally and playing and doing a great job. ”On the national scene, the most prominent MICR graduate is Calvin Gentry, an athlete promising enough to play representative rugby and even attract the attentions of a film crew – a project Young says is ongoing.  When the Guardian spoke to Young in December 2017, the powerful back-row forward was playing for Arkansas State. “The last spring when the world was normal,” Young says, referring to a time pre-Covid, Gentry “transferred back to University of Memphis, after his sophomore year, and then he led the Memphis Tigers to top 16 in the country in division two.  So on the field he’s done a great job [as he has] off the field.  He’s one of our best coaches here at MICR.  An incredible leader of young men. ”In answer to speculation in comment sections and Reddit threads, Young confirms that Gentry is “ready to go play in MLR”, meaning Major League Rugby, the US professional competition, though he “can’t say which team yet, as Calvin hasn’t announced it”.  If MLR’s fourth season survives Covid, it will kick-off in March. MICR, Young says, has been maintaining as much active rugby as possible across its network of schools.  Fittingly, though, the Beyond Sport award arrives at a time when much of MICR’s work is being done beyond the sports field. “We had to cancel a rugby season like everybody else,” Young says, “but we have all these great coaches and we have a small staff and we want to keep serving.  And so we just adapted and over the summer and spring we delivered thousands of bags of food and toilet paper and razor blades, batteries, you know, flashlights, different things to help keep our families at home, out of the grocery stores, out of the convenience stores and saving money. “And we’re able to pay our own alumni coaches, so essentially our own students, to do this work and to execute this plan.  And so they earned money while they were laid off of their jobs.  And they were able to help a lot of people in the process. ”The summer also saw nationwide protests against racial injustice, over the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis.  The moment, and the movement, touched MICR. “Memphis is more than 60% an African American city,” Young says.  “And so the protests inspired MICR to launch our first ever diversity, equity and inclusion committee, which is entirely led and operated by a cohort of our alumni, with the chairwoman Teyonce Harris and under the guidance of one of our board members, Isabel Rodriguez, who works for a great organisation called Facing History and Ourselves. ”The committee, he said, aims to pursue “different initiatives in terms of representing the students we serve properly in the makeup of our board of directors, the makeup of our staff”.  It also looks to “make sure our allocations and investment and our programming is designed not to discriminate or do the easy work, with maybe the students who are most available, but to make sure that our resources and our potential to make an impact is equitable in the communities, to make sure that our young women and young men are pushing our way and pulling us to do better. ”One person playing a key part in that push, he said, is programme coordinator Jordan Young. “Jordan is one of our first ever players to graduate college.  So he was one of the first freshmen back in 2012, graduated, played four years with us and then went to college, graduated in four years from the University of Memphis, and we just hired him and now he is coaching our coaches. ”#https://sports.yahoo.com/bravery-courage-trust-spirit-memphis-140007726.html#IswUuIU2l

Capable of very human behaviours and even similar facial expressions, it is not difficult to believe that we are so closely related.  This gorilla baby is enjoying some affectionate time with his mother, having just had his morning milk.  But what he does after he is finished is a behaviour that we have all seen young human children do very frequently.  He sticks a finger up his nose, looks at what he has pulled out and promptly pops his finger into his mouth.  He repeats this several times in a way that looks as if he has been exposed to human children and he has learned this from them.  The truth is that this baby has almost definitely not see this action performed by people and that he has simply learned it on his own for whatever reason.  This might suggest that some of the same instinctive behaviour is influencing the gorillas and ourselves in a similar way.  These are western lowland gorillas, the smaller of the subspecies, yet the males can reach a weight of 270kg (600lbs).  They have incredible strength and are reported to be 7-8 times as powerful as an Olympic weightlifter, although this is not easily verified.  standing erect, can reach a height of almost 2m (6ft).  They possess formidable teeth and jaw strength, capable of a biting force that is greater than a large dog.  Despite such immense power, gorillas are generally calm and non-aggressive unless disturbed or threatened.  Even the adult males, known as silverbacks, are not likely to attack humans unless provoked.  The western lowland gorilla is a critically endangered species.  These gorillas live at the Toronto Zoo, one of the world's highest rated zoos, and recipient of numerous top awards related to conditions and health programs for the animals.  They are world leaders in conservation efforts and education.  When considering which facilities to support or avoid, a little research goes a long way.  Supporting the organizations that are active in animal welfare around the world is crucial if we want to see animals like these survive. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/baby-gorilla-engages-surprisingly-human-152505557.html#3tSVQdJBO

Footage captured by Ian Beckley shows the clouds moving over Albuquerque from his perch on Sandia Crest mountain. Beckley told Storyful he decided to record a cloud video after he saw a cold front in the forecast that he thought would bring the right kind of cloudy conditions.  After six days of waking up at 2 am to drive to the top of Sandia Crest, which is approximately 10,000 feet tall, Beckley said the clouds dropped low enough for him to shoot the stunning sunrise video. “The city is at 6,000 feet and has mainly sunny days.  Getting any type of cloud inversion is very rare,” Beckley said. The National Weather Service predicted that a cold front would affect the region on the same date.

Wilson had been separated from her pet for two months as she cared for her father, who was undergoing cancer treatment, and harbored fears of Millie being upset by her absence.  “It was very hard to be away from her, and I was a little concerned she would be upset with me for leaving for so long,” she told Storyful.  Thankfully, those fears were unfounded and Millie gave her owner an enthusiastic welcome when she walked through her front door, as can be seen from a video on her Facebook account .  “After a very sad two months, it was a lovely welcome home,” she added.

A study into wild chimpanzees, based on 78,000 hours of observation, found that the apes focused on fewer, but more meaningful friendships in their later years.  Researchers claim it is the first evidence that a species other than humans alter how they socialise depending on their age.  Scientists from the Harvard department of human evolutionary biology looked at the social interactions of 21 chimps between the ages of 15 and 58 in a study spanning 1995 to 2016.  Their work was based at Kibale National Park in Uganda and focused specifically on male chimps, which build stronger social bonds and are more socially active than females.  It was found that older chimps preferred spending more time with - and grooming - chimps they had developed mutual friendships with over the years.  Younger chimps, however, had more one-sided relationships where grooming wasn't always returned.  Older males were also more likely to spend more time alone but interacted with more important social partners like their ageing mutual friends, the study, published in the journal Science, found.  Much like humans in their later years, the older chimps sought out peace and quiet more regularly and tended to make their social interactions more positive than negative.  Alexandra Rosati, an assistant professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan and one of the paper's lead authors, said: ""The really cool thing is that we found that chimpanzees are showing these patterns that mirror those of humans. "" She added: ""There's really a pressing need to understand the biology of ageing.  ""More humans are living longer than in the past, which can change the dynamics of ageing. "" Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology and founder and co-director of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project, said: ""Even though chimps are very smart, they do not understand they're going to die.  ""Much more likely something else is going on in chimps to explain why their relationships become more positive as they get older.  And then the question is what applies to chimps the same as what applies to humans. """#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/chimps-humans-share-same-interest-192653859.html#Hc66H8cFa

From its earliest mass swelling in the fertile heart of Polynesia, the culture of surfing grew as a playful device for altering, informing, and reinforcing cultural values.  Early surfing cultures adopted wave riding for its ability to create camaraderie and provide physical challenge, cultural cohesion, and experiential spirituality.  The origins of surfing in Polynesia made it clear that this was a cultural practice of deep and meaningful play for everyone: mothers, grandfathers, warriors, princesses, children.  Play and travel were, and still are, entwined with the definitions of what it means to be a surfer.  As our ancient ancestors did, we modern wave riders devote our lives to the pursuit of the vibrant edge that surfing offers – a deeply nourishing, and highly addictive, perpetual passion for one-more-wave that begs us on to both the most crowded and most remote swathes of sand by the planet’s oceans.  The sport and art of surfing was of such value to early Hawaiians that it was forbidden to work or wage war during prime surf season – everyone took a full three months off over winter for the Makahiki Festival, a period of spiritual cleansing and sport.  The ancients knew what we have forgotten: play is part of what makes us human.  Working too hard or too often doesn’t necessarily lead to increased productivity or happiness, or to a sense of community.  Neoteny – the retention of playful, childlike characteristics – is an essential part of human evolution because it opens up doors to creativity, spontaneity and visions of new ways of being in the world.  Most human cultures have tended to have more leisure time than work time.  In Hawaii, a culture rich in aquatic lore and myth abounded before the threats of colonisation.  Surfing was part of a sensuous way of life that also included hula dancing, chanting, and outlets for play entwined with spirituality.  But when European notions of religiosity, gender and the Protestant work ethic came to govern Polynesia and beyond, the wild freedom of wave riding was nearly lost, and later assumed as an endeavour only for men.  Historians of Ancient Polynesia acknowledge that it was women, in fact, who seemed to stand in the highest regard for their skill and poise as surfers.  Woven deep into the chants and lore of surfing culture are the stories of revered women – such as Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, and Princess Kelea – who rode the waves with the utmost grace and athleticism.  Right now, women are reclaiming our natural place in the global sport, art and culture of surfing.  While men’s performances and perspectives have tended to dominate in surfing, the past three decades have seen women’s participation increase exponentially.  Women now make up between 20 and 30 per cent of surfers, and that number continues to grow. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/life-ocean-wave-joy-freedom-091001339.html#j7tHPZfBG

Carol Danvers’ orange sidekick is actually a flerken (an alien with massive tentacles hidden inside her mouth), but Goose’s fluffy coat and knack for getting into trouble puts her firmly in the cat category. Binx, “Hocus Pocus” (1993)Thackery Binx was just a normal teenage boy in 1693 before he was cursed to live forever in the body of a black cat.  But hey, everyone goes through weird phases in their teens. Cat, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” (1961)Let’s make this clear: Holly Golightly does not own this cat.  He belongs to nobody and nobody belongs to him.  But that doesn’t stop him from playing a pivotal role in the movie, including the tear-jerking final scene. Jonesy, “Alien” (1979)This orange tabby was the unofficial mascot of the USCSS Nostromo and one of the few crew members to survive a Xenomorph attack.  He also remains the only character to successfully steal a scene from Sigourney Weaver. Mr.  Jinx, “Meet the Parents” (2000)This movie should actually be called “Meet the Parents’ Cat,” because Mr.  Jinx is the real star.  The perpetually-frowning Himalayan cat is Jack Byrnes’ pride and joy, and knows how to come when called, wave and even use the toilet.  That’s called a ‘triple threat’ in showbiz. Tonto, “Harry and Tonto” (1974)Art Carney’s portrayal of a feisty retiree on a cross-country road trip won him an Academy Award, while his feline costar didn’t even get a nomination.  What gives?Church, “Pet Sematary” (1989, 2019)Ellie Creed’s playful kitty Winston Churchill was run over by a truck and came back from the dead as Church to terrorize his former owners.  That’s something to consider before burying your cat in a cursed cemetery. Ulysses, “Inside Llewyn Davis” (2013)This honey-colored tabby joined Oscar Isaac’s grumpy folk musician as he wandered around New York City and Chicago in the Coen brothers’ film.  Though he takes up more screen time than many of the human actors, the feline actor isn’t named in the credits — perhaps because the character was played by three separate (but equally adorable) animal performers. Mr.  Bigglesworth, “Austin Powers” series When Dr.  Evil’s cat, Mr.  Bigglesworth, gets upset, people die.  Honestly, Dr.  Evil doesn’t sound too different from the average cat owner. Fat Louie, “The Princess Diaries” (2001)Behind every great princess of Genovia is an equally great black-and-white kitty.

Grab a nice big handful of walnuts.  Both of these foods are rich in omega-3 fatty acids (aka ""essential fatty acids""), which are long chains of fats that are actually good for you and are known for supporting heart health.  In fact, new findings suggest that eating more of them regularly may even help save your life if you were to ever suffer from a heart attack. A recent study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology took a look at heart attack patients who were admitted to the hospital and found that those who had higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids were less likely to die, or even require re-hospitalization, during the three years following their heart attack compared to other patients.  Specifically, this research looked for two kinds omega-3s—eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)—in the bloodwork of 944 heart attack patients with an average age of 61,  209 of which were women.  (Related: 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time. )EPA has already been associated with a lower risk of heart attack, and its best-known food source is fatty fish, including salmon and mackerel.  ALA has also already been associated with a lower risk of death in the event of a heart attack, and its best food sources include walnuts, flaxseeds, and canola oil.  After following the heart attack patients' progress for three years, the researchers found that those with higher levels of EPA and ALA in their blood at the time they were admitted to the hospital for a heart attack were more likely to be alive at the end of the study.  Those with higher levels of EPA were also less likely to require readmission to the hospital during that timeframe.  From this, the scientists concluded that a diet rich in omega-3s could serve as a smart heart attack prevention strategy.

More inquisitive and more intelligent than we give them credit for, they are much like giant puppies in their personalities.  These calves live on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario.  They wander freely in the meadow for most of the year, exploring the woods and rolling hills, and they drink fresh water from the ponds on the farm.  They are part of a large, and very happy herd that enjoy the freedom here, grazing contentedly throughout the day.  They are joined by Gus, a huge, but relaxed bull that watches over his herd protectively.  These calves have gathered around to check out a new visitor in their meadow.  They are very curious about the small camera that he has and they watch him carefully, although they are reluctant to approach him close enough to sniff at the strange object that he is holding.  He puts the camera down in the grass and moves back a few steps.  Predictably, the calves gather around and look even more closely.  They can't resist the urge to get a good look and even lick at the camera.  The result is some very adorable footage of their noses and eyes peering right into the lens.  But when one of them nudges the camera and it tips over in the grass, they all jump in unison and get ready to run.  When nothing dangerous happens, they slowly return to their investigation of the amusing object. #https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/other/calves-adorably-startled-when-they-tip-over-the-camera/vi-BB1afATq?li=BBnbklE#n0JlQQkST

Although it was initially intended for his family's enjoyment, over the years it’s grown into a neighborhood “must-see,” and an attraction that their community looks forward to visiting each year on Halloween.  When Pace’s wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, this endeavor became a passion project and he started to out-do himself with each passing Halloween season.  Decorations and massive displays brought joy to his wife and the whole neighborhood, but also became an avenue to raise money for local charities. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/family-builds-hogwarts-castle-front-163300020.html#0SM5w0umV

Members of the public had seen the fox trapped in Saint Saviour’s Dock, Southwark, on a muddy bank.  The fox had been cornered by the river and the incoming tide, RSPCA inspector Rebecca Phillips said in a press release by the animal welfare group. As the water rose, the animal sought safety on the hull of the small rowboat. “He climbed onto the hull of the boat to escape the water.  Firefighters managed to hook the rope for the boat, and carefully pulled it over to a scaffolding platform, crossing the river underneath a bridge so we could try to catch him,” Phillips said. According to the same press release, as rescuers prepared their equipment and assessed the best way to catch the fox, the frightened critter slipped off the boat and into the water. Phillips said that she looked “frantically” for a minute and heard scratching underneath her feet, before spotting the fox, who had jumped onto a scaffolding pole below. “I managed to loop my grasper around his body to secure him and get a hand onto his rear end to pull him up onto the platform,” she said.  “We’d attracted quite a crowd, so it’s great that they were able to see him being saved and that we got a lovely, happy ending. ”The fox was fed and dried off, before he was brought to a safe place and released back into the wild.

Sold signs, hitherto a rarity, have begun appearing, like vivid Post-its, on the brick-and-stucco façades of next-door houses.  Worn out by months of lockdown, many of her neighbours are quitting town and heading to the country to discover a greener, quieter way of life.  Trelawny, 48, a caterer to leading fashion designers and magazines, isn’t joining the exodus.  The mother of two grew up in the Cotswolds, surrounded by ‘fields and valleys, dogs and endless ponies: Cider with Rosie stuff ’.  Drawing on those memories, she’s cultivated her own urban idyll here.  Gilt-framed oils chorus from leaf-green walls, while brown furniture and chintzy upholstery give this town house the charm of an old fashioned rectory. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/bring-countryside-city-home-104416142.html#5OXan4QJi

Her instruction was to meow like a cat — out loud — during the assignment.  students received bonus points if they meowed on their test — but apparently, more than 90 percent of them failed to do so.  As several kids meowed, some students seemed baffled by the situation.  “Why was everyone saying ‘meow?'”.  As one of her students explained, it was “a test to see who was listening”.  The method earned praise from parents and teachers on TikTok, with several users commenting that it was a “great idea”.  “My high schoolers would start meowing just because others were,” one user wrote.  Others were more critical, saying many students might feel too nervous to make a strange noise out loud during a test.  “Sounds good except my son has anxiety that won’t allow him to do that,” one user wrote#https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/teacher-tiktok-shares-genius-trick-210823121.html#CnoS9Rh8O

And then he had to move to Texas for his work.  He thought he’d never see Blue again. ” The shelter said Pat’s friend spotted a video showing his beloved pet playing ball at their facility, prompting Pat to contact them immediately to make arrangements.  Footage posted to Facebook shows the moment Pat was reunited with Blue after making the trip from Texas to Johnson City, Tennessee, where the shelter is located.  “We don’t many happy endings like this one,” the shelter wrote.  “There were some tears, tons of doggie kisses and lots of smiles.

The island has lush green forested areas in the highlands, dry areas on the coast that resemble an arid desert, a thriving town, and wildlife that is diverse and fascinating.  One of the most iconic animals in the world, the giant Galapagos Tortoise makes its home here.  Loved and well protected by the residents, these tortoises have seen a dramatic increase in numbers since their conservation efforts have been implemented.  The tortoises draw thousands of tourists each year, which is important to people living in this remote world.  The tortoises also represent a very important part of the overall health of the fragile ecosystem.  Galapagos tortoises wander freely on Santa Cruz.  There are rehab and captive breeding centers, as well as more protected areas, but the tortoises are free to roam wherever they please, often making long treks to find nesting areas or breeding opportunities.  Living as long as 200 years, and possibly longer, these tortoises will lay many eggs in their lifetime.  They will also grow to a staggering 225kg (500lbs) with a shell large enough to fill the passenger compartment of a small car.  It is always a treat for the residents, or the tourists, to find a tortoise on the move.  This giant male had taken a casual stroll down a bike path, making his way from the highlands in the direction of the ocean far below.  Solon and his daughter were driving past in their electric car when they spotted the giant beast enjoying a rest and a meal at the side of the pedestrian/bike path.  They stopped so that Solon could capture the moment and also so that he could deliver a short nature lesson for Abigail and others who would see his video later.  Abigail seems interested enough, but these are animals that she will see frequently as she grows up on this incredible island.  She will see sea lions, pelicans, crabs, iguanas and stingrays here regularly as well.  These animals that the rest of us will likely only see on nature shows make their home all around her.  The people of the Galapagos Islands have a love and respect for the wildlife that is second to none.  They maintain their distance and respectfully avoid interfering with any of the animals.  They will gently guide or correct any of the tourists who are tempted to bend or break the rules with respect to distance or feeding of the wildlife, knowing that nature does not need any help from mankind.  The people of the Galapagos Islands are leaders in environmental responsibility.  They have banned single use plastics.  They allow only taxis, small motorcycles and electric cars on the island.  In this way, pollution is kept to a minimum.  They also understand and protect the delicate balance that is important to the native species. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gigantic-galapagos-tortoise-leave-awe-235839320.html#JT5izQd86

For Americans facing the COVID-19 lockdown and economic instability through the spring and summer, that became a difficult question to ask--and to answer.  Things were already pretty bad.  And then the presidential election began in earnest.

According to a new report based on three surveys by the nonpartisan organization More in Common, 'About 7 in 10 Americans are worried about the risk of widespread violence breaking out across the country after election results are announced. ' In this article, Greater Good offers eight inquiries that can help us navigate this period. #http://www.dailygood.org/view.php?qid=8630#3OUjPbuc4

Here we see one bathing in a backyard pond.  Although it looks very angry, it's clear it is having a very good time! As it splashes and dips into the water, the facial features and markings over the eyes make it appear to be holding a serious frown.  These birds are called ""American Robins"" because they are native to North America, and because they have a red breast, similar to the European robin.  But the European robin is flycatcher and is in a completely different family.  The American robin is actually a thrush, and a songbird.  They are abundantly found in all types of habitat.  Robins are significant carriers and spreaders of the dangerous West Nile Virus.  Although we typically blame crows and jays for this spread, because we see the die from it early and in larger numbers, the robin is just as capable of contracting the virus and then living longer, promoting a greater spread to humans through the mosquitos which are the intermediary hosts.  Robins have keen eyesight to help them find their prey; grubs, insects and earthworms, but they actually use their hearing to find food as well.  The robin listens carefully for the sound of an earthworm moving just beneath the surface of the ground.  It can detect the worm and pounce, pulling it from its hole.  They use smell and even detect vibration to find their food.  It is believed that birds like the robin bathe in water or in dust to maintain the preferred amount of oil on their feathers and to discourage mites and other parasites.

Ivy previously appeared in a video that went viral in which Dean sang the Burt Bacharach song What the World Needs Now Is Love.  Writing on Instagram, Dawn said that Ivy’s no longer a “lap donkey. ”The Fagans run Jackass Junction, a 67-acre donkey sanctuary where they care for rescued farm animals.  Dawn manages their social media pages and regularly posts footage of the farm’s residents.

For years it was believed that the endangered Fin Whale sang just one song pattern, which is unique to the males in his particular group.  But using underwater microphones researchers have discovered they can produce different melodies that spread to other parts of the ocean as groups travel.  A total of 116 whale encounters were analysed near Kauai, which is part of the Hawaiian archipelago, over the course of six years.  Recordings discovered that while male fin whales living in the Pacific Ocean only sing two notes at a very low pitch, these are produced in different rhythms to create songs.  Five main patterns of songs were recorded in the area, some of which were geographically unique, but others were similar to those recorded in whale groups off the north-west coast of the US. #https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/whales-swap-songs-other-groups-163957818.html#LCqYrNIIn
